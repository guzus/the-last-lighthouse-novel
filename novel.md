# The Last Lighthouse

## A Novel by Claude

## Part I: The Keeper

### Chapter 1: The Storm

The wind howled across the rocky cliffs like a wounded animal, carrying with it the salt spray of the churning sea below. Emma Thornton gripped the iron railing of the lighthouse gallery, her knuckles white against the rust-spotted metal. Forty years she had lived in this isolated outpost, and still, storms like this one made her blood run cold.

"Just another tempest," she muttered to herself, though her voice was swallowed by the gale before it could offer any comfort.

The lighthouse beam swept across the darkness in its eternal rotation, a defiant circle of light against the encroaching night. One hundred and eighty-seven steps separated her from the warm kitchen below, where a pot of tea sat cooling on the ancient stove. Emma had climbed those steps ten thousand times, maybe more. Each ascent was a meditation, each descent a return to the ordinary world.

But tonight was different.

Through the sheets of rain, Emma caught sight of something impossible—a ship, far too close to the rocks, its sails torn and flapping like the wings of a dying bird. Her heart hammered in her chest as she reached for the emergency flare gun mounted on the gallery wall.

### Chapter 2: The Survivor

Dawn broke grey and reluctant over the wreckage. Emma had not slept. She had watched through the night as the ship—a beautiful old schooner that had no business being in these waters—was dashed against the rocks. She had fired flares, radioed the coast guard, done everything in her power.

But the storm had been too fierce, the response too slow.

Now, as pale light filtered through the dissipating clouds, Emma made her way down the treacherous cliff path to the beach. Debris littered the shoreline: splintered wood, torn canvas, a ship's wheel split cleanly in half.

And then she saw him.

A man, perhaps thirty years old, lay crumpled against a boulder, his dark hair matted with salt and blood. Emma's practiced hands checked for a pulse—weak, but steady. Without hesitation, she began the arduous task of dragging him up the cliff path, her lighthouse keeper's strength put to the test.

### Chapter 3: Questions Without Answers

For three days, the stranger slept in Emma's spare bedroom, the one that had once belonged to her daughter, before she had grown up and moved to the mainland, before the letters had stopped coming. Emma tended to his wounds with the methodical care of someone who had no choice but to become her own doctor, nurse, and pharmacist.

On the fourth morning, his eyes opened.

They were an unusual shade of grey, like storm clouds just before they break. He stared at Emma for a long moment, confusion giving way to something else—recognition? Fear?

"Where am I?" His voice was rough, unused.

"Thornton Light," Emma replied, setting down the bowl of broth she had been preparing. "You were shipwrecked. I'm Emma. You're lucky to be alive."

The man struggled to sit up, wincing at the effort. "The ship... the others..."

"I'm sorry," Emma said quietly. "You were the only one I found."

He closed his eyes, and Emma saw grief wash over his features like a wave. When he opened them again, something had changed.

"My name is Marcus," he said. "And that ship... we were looking for something. Something important."

### Chapter 4: The Map

Marcus recovered slowly, but with each passing day, he grew stronger. Emma found herself enjoying the company, the sound of another voice in the lighthouse besides her own. They fell into an easy rhythm—she maintaining the light, he helping with repairs and cooking meals that were far more elaborate than her usual fare.

One evening, as they sat by the fire, Marcus reached into the waterproof pouch he had been wearing when Emma found him. From it, he pulled a folded piece of oilcloth. When he unwrapped it, Emma saw an old map, intricate and carefully drawn.

"This is what we were searching for," Marcus said, spreading it across the wooden table. "My grandfather spent his entire life looking for this place."

Emma leaned closer. The map showed a coastline—this coastline, she realized—with a marking at the exact location of Thornton Light. But there was something else, something drawn beneath the lighthouse itself.

"What is it?" she asked.

"A chamber," Marcus replied. "According to the legend, it was built by the original lighthouse keepers, back in the 1800s. They were smugglers, you see, and they needed a place to hide their most valuable cargo."

Emma sat back, her mind racing. "I've been here forty years. I've explored every inch of this lighthouse. There's no hidden chamber."

Marcus smiled, a spark of excitement in his grey eyes. "Then we haven't looked hard enough."

## Part II: The Search

### Chapter 5: The Foundation

They began in the cellar, that dank and forgotten space where Emma stored coal and emergency supplies. Marcus worked with the intensity of a man possessed, tapping on stones, measuring distances, comparing everything to the dimensions shown on the map.

"According to this," he said, holding up a lantern, "the chamber should be directly beneath the central column, the one that supports the entire lighthouse structure."

Emma frowned. "That's solid bedrock. My husband—" she paused, the word still painful even after all these years "—he checked it when we first arrived. We had concerns about the foundation settling."

"And?"

"And he found nothing unusual. Just rock."

But Marcus was undeterred. He produced a small hammer and chisel from his salvaged belongings and began working on a section of the cellar wall that, according to the map, should lead to the hidden space.

Three hours later, the chisel broke through into emptiness.

### Chapter 6: The Descent

The opening was narrow, barely wide enough for a person to squeeze through. Marcus went first, holding the lantern ahead of him, Emma following close behind. The passage was crude, carved from the living rock by hands that had worked in secret, probably at night, while the lighthouse keeper's family slept upstairs.

They descended perhaps twenty feet before the passage opened into a chamber.

Emma gasped.

The room was perhaps fifteen feet square, its walls lined with wooden shelves. But the shelves were empty, save for dust and the skeletal remains of what might once have been wooden crates.

"It's been cleaned out," Marcus said, his disappointment evident. "Someone got here first."

But Emma had noticed something else. In the far corner of the chamber, partially hidden by shadow, was a wooden desk. On it sat a single leather-bound book.

### Chapter 7: The Journal

They brought the journal up to the lighthouse, handling it with the reverence due to such an ancient artifact. The leather cover was cracked and brittle, but the pages inside, though yellowed with age, were still legible.

Emma opened it carefully. On the first page, in elegant script, was written:

*The Private Journal of Captain Ezra Thornton*
*Keeper of the Light, 1847-1873*

"Thornton," Emma whispered. "That's... that's my married name."

Marcus leaned over her shoulder. "Your husband's ancestor?"

"Must be." Emma turned the page and began to read aloud.

The journal told a story of a man caught between duty and survival, between the law and the needs of his family. Captain Ezra Thornton had indeed been a smuggler, but not of the romantic sort found in stories. He had smuggled people—refugees fleeing persecution, slaves escaping bondage, anyone who could pay the passage and needed to disappear.

The chamber below the lighthouse had been their hiding place, sometimes for days or weeks, until ships could be arranged to carry them to safety in Canada or across the Atlantic.

### Chapter 8: The Legacy

As Emma read deeper into the journal, a pattern emerged. Captain Ezra had recorded names, dates, destinations—a complete archive of everyone he had helped. Hundreds of people, maybe thousands, over his twenty-six years as keeper.

"This is extraordinary," Marcus breathed. "Do you know what this means? These people, their descendants—they could trace their family histories back through this journal."

Emma nodded slowly, her mind grasping the significance. "It's not treasure, not the kind you can spend. But it's worth more than gold to the right people."

"Is that why you were searching for it?" she asked, looking at Marcus. "For your grandfather?"

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was thick with emotion. "My grandfather's grandmother came through here. He found a letter she had written, mentioning the lighthouse, the keeper who saved her life. He spent years trying to prove the story was true, but he died before he could find any evidence."

"And the ship? The others?"

"A research team," Marcus said. "Historians, genealogists. We were trying to verify the legends, to find proof that this underground railroad station existed." He looked away. "I got them killed, chasing a family story."

Emma placed her hand on his. "You didn't kill anyone. The storm did that. And you did find proof. Your grandfather was right."

## Part III: The Light

### Chapter 9: The Decision

Over the following weeks, Emma and Marcus worked together to preserve and document the journal. They took photographs of every page, created a digital archive, reached out to historical societies and universities.

The response was overwhelming.

Within a month, the lighthouse was besieged by researchers, journalists, and descendants of the people Captain Ezra had saved. The Coast Guard, which had been planning to automate Thornton Light and retire Emma, suddenly reversed course. The lighthouse was declared a historical landmark.

Emma found herself thrust into a role she had never imagined—curator, historian, guardian of a legacy she hadn't known she possessed.

But with Marcus's help, she rose to the challenge.

### Chapter 10: The Choice

Summer brought warm winds and calm seas. The lighthouse, once Emma's prison of solitude, had become a hub of activity and life. Visitors came to see the chamber, to read the journal entries, to touch the stones that their ancestors had once touched.

Marcus, who had intended to stay only until he recovered, found reasons to remain. He became Emma's assistant, her partner in managing the sudden influx of interest and attention.

One evening, as they sat on the gallery watching the sun set over the ocean, Emma turned to him.

"You could leave now, you know," she said. "You've done what you came to do. Proven your grandfather's story. There's nothing keeping you here."

Marcus was quiet for a moment, watching the light begin its nightly rotation.

"There's you," he said simply.

Emma felt her breath catch. "I'm an old woman, Marcus. You have your whole life ahead of you."

"You're sixty-two," he countered. "That's not old. And my whole life..." He paused, searching for words. "I've spent it searching for the past, for proof of stories that may or may not have been true. But here, with you, I've found something real. Something present."

"The lighthouse?"

"Home," Marcus said. "I've found home."

### Chapter 11: The Storm Returns

Autumn brought the storms again, great rolling tempests that battered the coast and tested the endurance of the lighthouse. But this year, Emma did not face them alone. Marcus stood beside her on the gallery, watching the waves crash against the rocks, both of them ready to spring into action if any vessel strayed too close.

The light turned, steady and sure, a beacon in the darkness.

One night, during a particularly fierce gale, they spotted it—another ship in distress, driven toward the rocks by winds too strong to fight.

Without a word, they moved into action. Emma radioed the coast guard while Marcus fired flares. Together, they guided the struggling vessel to safety, their coordinated efforts born of months of working side by side.

When the ship finally reached safe harbor, Emma and Marcus stood together in the lighthouse, rain-soaked and exhausted.

"Thank you," the ship's captain radioed. "The light saved us. You saved us."

Emma looked at Marcus, saw in his eyes the reflection of the beacon above them.

"That's what we do," she said into the radio. "That's what we've always done."

### Chapter 12: The Gathering

On the anniversary of Marcus's shipwreck, they held a ceremony at the lighthouse. Descendants of the people Captain Ezra had saved came from around the world—over two hundred of them, gathering on the clifftops to honor the man who had given their ancestors a chance at life.

Emma stood before them, the journal in her hands, and read from its pages. Stories of courage and desperation, of families torn apart and reunited, of hope preserved in the darkest of times.

When she finished, an elderly woman approached her. She was perhaps ninety, with kind eyes and a gentle smile.

"My great-great-grandmother came through this lighthouse," she said. "Because of Captain Ezra, she survived. She married, had children, built a life. I exist because of what he did."

She took Emma's hand. "And now, because of you, we know the truth. We know our history. Thank you for keeping the light burning."

Emma felt tears on her cheeks, but they were not tears of sadness.

"The light was always here," she said. "I just kept it clean and bright. That's all any of us can do—tend the light, and pass it on to the next keeper."

## Epilogue: The New Dawn

Five years later, Emma stood once again on the lighthouse gallery, watching the sunrise paint the ocean in shades of gold and rose. Marcus stood beside her, his arm around her shoulders.

The lighthouse had become more than a beacon for ships—it was now a museum, a research center, a place of pilgrimage for those seeking to understand their past.

But more importantly, it was a home.

Emma thought of her daughter, who had reconciled with her after years of silence, and who now visited regularly with Emma's grandchildren. She thought of the countless visitors who had passed through, each one touched by the stories the lighthouse held.

She thought of Captain Ezra, that long-dead keeper who had risked everything to help strangers find freedom.

"Do you think he knew?" Marcus asked, as if reading her thoughts. "Captain Ezra. Do you think he knew that his story would matter, centuries later?"

Emma considered this. "I don't think he did it for the story. I think he did it because it was right, because when you have a light, you share it. The fact that we remember... that's just a bonus."

Marcus smiled. "The light endures."

"The light endures," Emma agreed.

Below them, the ocean rolled eternal, and above them, the lighthouse beam turned, steady and sure, a promise kept across generations—that in the darkest night, there would always be a light to guide the lost home.

## Part IV: The Next Keeper

### Chapter 13: The Letter

The envelope arrived on a Tuesday, carried by the weekly mail boat that served the lighthouse. Emma recognized the handwriting immediately—her daughter Sarah's elegant script, though there was something hurried about it, less controlled than usual.

Marcus brought it to her in the study, where she was cataloging a new batch of letters that had been donated to the museum—correspondence from families whose ancestors had passed through Captain Ezra's underground station.

"From Sarah," he said, concern evident in his voice. He had learned to read Emma's expressions over the years, and he saw her frown as she examined the envelope.

Emma slit it open with the old brass letter opener that had belonged to Captain Ezra himself. As she read, Marcus watched the color drain from her face.

"What is it?"

"It's David," Emma said quietly, referring to her teenage grandson. "He's been expelled from school. Sarah says he's been in trouble for months—skipping classes, getting into fights. She doesn't know what to do with him."

She handed Marcus the letter. His eyes scanned the page, stopping at the final paragraph: *Mom, I know I have no right to ask, but could David come stay with you for the summer? Maybe the lighthouse, the structure, the purpose—maybe it could help him find his way. You helped me once, when I was lost. Maybe you can help him too.*

Marcus looked up. "What do you want to do?"

Emma walked to the window, gazing out at the ocean that had been her constant companion for over four decades. "I want to say yes. But I'm not sure I'm the right person for this. I drove Sarah away once. What if I do the same to David?"

"You didn't drive her away," Marcus said gently. "She left because she needed to find her own path. And she came back, didn't she? Maybe David needs to find his path too."

Emma turned back to him, seeing the wisdom in his storm-grey eyes. "Then we'll need to prepare. A sixteen-year-old boy won't be easy."

Marcus smiled. "Neither was a sixty-two-year-old lighthouse keeper. But I managed."

### Chapter 14: The Arrival

David Thornton arrived three weeks later, slouching off the mail boat with a battered duffel bag and a scowl that could curdle milk. He was tall for sixteen, with his mother's dark hair and his grandmother's sharp eyes, though his were currently hidden behind an expression of practiced indifference.

Emma met him at the dock, Marcus standing slightly behind her. She resisted the urge to embrace him—the body language was clear. Instead, she simply said, "Hello, David. Welcome to Thornton Light."

"Hey." The word was barely more than a grunt.

The climb up to the lighthouse was silent except for the cry of gulls and the ever-present sound of waves. Emma noticed David glancing around despite his apparent disinterest—at the rocky cliffs, the weathered buildings, the lighthouse tower rising stark and white against the sky.

"You'll stay in the keeper's cottage," Emma said, leading him to the small building adjacent to the main lighthouse. "Marcus and I live in the main quarters, but you'll have your privacy here. There's no internet, but we do have satellite phone for emergencies."

"No internet." David's voice dripped with disbelief. "What am I supposed to do?"

"We'll find plenty for you to do," Emma replied. "The lighthouse doesn't run itself."

### Chapter 15: The Rules

That first dinner was an exercise in awkward silence. David pushed food around his plate, answered questions with monosyllables, and radiated hostility like heat from a stove.

Finally, Marcus set down his fork. "All right, let's lay out the ground rules."

David looked up, suspicion flaring in his eyes.

"Rule one," Marcus continued, "you're here for the summer, which means roughly twelve weeks. You can fight it every step of the way, or you can make the best of it. Your choice."

"Rule two: the lighthouse keeps a schedule. The light must be maintained, the equipment checked, the grounds kept. We all contribute. Your grandmother and I will teach you what needs to be done."

"I didn't ask to come here," David said.

"No," Emma agreed. "But you're here anyway. And while you're here, you're part of this lighthouse. That means something."

"It means I'm stuck on a rock in the middle of nowhere with no friends, no phone, nothing."

Emma leaned forward. "It means you're the great-great-great-grandson of Captain Ezra Thornton, one of the bravest men who ever lived. It means you carry a legacy whether you like it or not. And it means that for the next twelve weeks, you have a chance to figure out who you are when all the noise and distraction is stripped away."

David stared at her for a long moment, then pushed back from the table. "May I be excused?"

"You may. The cottage is yours. But be up at six tomorrow morning. The light doesn't wait."

### Chapter 16: The Work

David was not up at six. Marcus had to physically drag him out of bed at six-thirty, and the boy stumbled through the morning routine with the grace of a drunken elephant.

Emma set him to work scrubbing the lighthouse windows—all two hundred and forty-seven panes of them. It was tedious, repetitive work, the kind that gave you too much time to think. She had done it herself a thousand times in her early years here.

By noon, David's arms ached, and his hands were raw. He found Emma in the museum section of the lighthouse, carefully reframing an old photograph.

"I'm done with the windows," he announced.

Emma looked up, then past him to the tower. Even from here, she could see the streaks and smudges he had missed. "Are you?"

David followed her gaze and had the grace to look embarrassed. "I... I'll fix them."

"David." Emma's voice stopped him. "If you're going to do something, do it right. Captain Ezra used to say that a lighthouse keeper's work is never seen until it's not done properly. People only notice the light when it fails."

"I'm not a lighthouse keeper."

"For the next twelve weeks, you are."

He went back to the windows. This time, he took his time, and when Emma checked his work that evening, she nodded in approval. "Better. Much better."

### Chapter 17: The Journal

It was Marcus who first showed David the journal. They were in the underground chamber—which was now accessible via a proper staircase rather than a crude passage—and David was helping to install new lighting for visitors.

"Your great-great-great-grandfather wrote this," Marcus said, carefully opening the leather-bound book. "He saved hundreds of lives with what he did here."

David glanced at the pages, then away. "So what? That was like a million years ago."

"A hundred and seventy-five years," Marcus corrected. "And you're wrong about it not mattering. Here." He flipped to a specific entry and began to read.

*June 15th, 1852. A family came through tonight—mother, father, three children, the youngest barely able to walk. They had traveled for months, hiding by day, moving by night. The father's hands were scarred from years of labor, the mother's eyes hollow with fear. But when I showed them the chamber, when I promised them safe passage, I saw something else in those eyes. Hope. That is what we trade in here, not goods or gold. We trade in hope.*

Marcus closed the journal. "Your great-great-great-grandfather wasn't doing this for glory or recognition. He did it because it was right. Because someone had to."

David was quiet for a moment. "What happened to them? The family."

"According to Captain Ezra's records, they made it to Canada. The children grew up free. One of them became a doctor, another a teacher." Marcus smiled. "Their descendants came to the ceremony five years ago. Would you like to see the photographs?"

For the first time since arriving, David looked genuinely interested. "Yeah. Yeah, I would."

### Chapter 18: The Photographs

Marcus led David upstairs to the museum room, where filing cabinets lined one wall, each drawer meticulously labeled. He pulled out a folder marked "Ceremony 2020 - Descendants Gathering."

Inside were dozens of photographs: families of every shade and background, standing together on the clifftop, smiling at the camera. Marcus spread them across the table, then found a specific image—a group of about fifteen people, ranging from elderly to children.

"This is the Morrison family," Marcus said. "Descendants of that family Captain Ezra wrote about in 1852. The father who came through the lighthouse was named Samuel Morrison. He was escaping slavery in Virginia."

David picked up the photograph, studying the faces. A little girl in the front row, maybe seven years old, was missing her two front teeth and grinning widely.

"That's Jasmine Morrison," Marcus continued. "She's seven. She wants to be a marine biologist. She exists because her great-great-great-great-grandfather made it through this lighthouse one hundred and seventy-three years ago."

"That's a lot of greats," David murmured, but he was still looking at the photograph.

"It is. And here's the thing—she has no idea who she'll become, what she'll do with her life. But she has a chance to find out, because someone, a long time ago, decided that helping a stranger was worth the risk."

David set down the photograph and picked up another. This one showed an elderly Black man in a wheelchair, surrounded by what appeared to be several generations of family.

"That's Reverend Thomas Hughes," Marcus said quietly. "Ninety-six years old when this was taken. He passed away last year. His great-grandmother came through this lighthouse in 1861, pregnant and alone, her husband sold to a plantation in Mississippi. Captain Ezra hid her for three weeks until a ship could be arranged. She gave birth to her daughter in that chamber downstairs."

David looked at Marcus. "Three weeks? Down there?"

"There was a living area, bedding, supplies. Captain Ezra and his wife took care of everyone who passed through." Marcus paused. "Reverend Hughes spent his whole life working for civil rights. He marched with Dr. King, registered voters in Alabama, built three churches. When he came here for the ceremony, you know what he said?"

David shook his head.

"He said, 'I'm here to thank the keeper who saved my great-grandmother. But I'm also here to thank the keeper who preserved the story. Because both mattered. Both kept the light burning.'" Marcus looked at Emma, who had appeared in the doorway. "He was talking about your grandmother."

David glanced at Emma, something shifting in his expression. Not quite respect, not yet, but something less hostile. "You did all this?"

Emma shook her head. "Marcus and I did it together. And we had help from dozens of researchers, historians, descendants. That's the thing about light, David—it's not meant to be hoarded. It's meant to be shared, amplified, passed on."

"I still don't see what this has to do with me," David said, but his voice lacked its earlier edge.

"Maybe nothing," Emma admitted. "Or maybe everything. That's what you're here to figure out."

### Chapter 19: The Storm Watch

Three weeks into his stay, David had settled into the rhythm of lighthouse life. He still wasn't happy about being there, but the open rebellion had faded into grudging cooperation. He woke at six without being called, completed his chores without complaint, and spent his evenings reading books from Emma's extensive library—mostly adventure novels and historical accounts of maritime disasters.

Then came the storm.

It rolled in on a Thursday evening, the barometer dropping so fast that Emma checked it twice to make sure it wasn't malfunctioning. Marcus began securing everything that could blow away while Emma checked and rechecked the lighthouse equipment.

"David!" Emma called. "We need you up in the tower!"

David appeared, pulling on the waterproof jacket Emma had given him. "What's happening?"

"Big storm, moving fast. We need all hands ready." Emma was already climbing the stairs, David and Marcus following. "The forecast says it could be worse than the one that wrecked Marcus's ship."

They reached the gallery just as the first raindrops began to fall, fat and heavy. Within minutes, it was a deluge. The wind shrieked across the rocks, and the ocean below transformed into a churning mass of grey-green chaos.

"What do I do?" David shouted over the wind.

"Watch!" Emma shouted back. "Watch for anything out there—boats, debris, distress signals. And be ready to help if we need you!"

For the next six hours, they kept vigil. Emma monitored the radio, Marcus scanned the horizon with binoculars, and David—despite his inexperience—watched the ocean with an intensity that reminded Emma of herself at a younger age.

At midnight, David spotted it.

"There!" He pointed toward a section of angry water about a mile offshore. "I saw a light! Like a flare!"

Marcus swung the binoculars in that direction. "He's right! I see it! Small vessel, looks like a fishing boat!"

Emma was already on the radio, calling the coast guard, relaying coordinates. But the response was grim—no rescue vessels could launch in these conditions. They were at least three hours away, maybe more.

"They won't make it three hours," Marcus said, lowering the binoculars. "That boat's taking on water. I can see it listing."

Emma made a decision. "David, get the emergency spotlight from the equipment room. Marcus, help me with the signal flags. We're going to guide them in."

"Guide them in?" David stared at her. "Grandma, the rocks—"

"There's a channel," Emma said. "It's narrow, and it's dangerous, but it's the only chance they have. We're going to light it for them."

What followed was the most terrifying and exhilarating experience of David's young life. Following Emma's barked instructions, he positioned the spotlight, sweeping it in the pattern she specified—two long, one short, two long—to mark the safe channel through the rocks.

Marcus deployed signal flares, creating a visual pathway. And Emma, her voice calm and steady despite the chaos, radioed instructions to the fishing boat, talking them through every turn, every hazard.

"Ten degrees starboard... steady... now hard to port... steady... you're doing fine... keep your bow into the waves..."

David's arms ached from holding the spotlight steady, but he didn't falter. He could see the boat now, a small trawler with two people visible on deck, fighting to keep it under control.

The boat scraped past a jagged rock with inches to spare.

"Steady!" Emma commanded. "You're almost through!"

And then, miraculously, the boat emerged into the calmer water of the sheltered cove beside the lighthouse. David watched as it limped toward the small dock, battered but intact.

"They made it," he breathed. "They actually made it."

Emma squeezed his shoulder. "We made it. Good work, David."

It was the first time she had praised him, and David felt something warm bloom in his chest, something that had been absent for a long time.

Pride.

## THE END

## Author's Note

This novel explores themes of legacy, redemption, and the quiet heroism of those who keep the lights burning—literally and metaphorically—through the darkest of times. The lighthouse serves as both a setting and a symbol, representing the enduring human need to guide, to protect, and to preserve the stories that matter.

While this is a work of fiction, it is inspired by the true stories of lighthouse keepers who aided escaping slaves along the Underground Railroad, and by the countless individuals throughout history who risked everything to help strangers find freedom.

May we all tend our lights well, and pass them on brighter than we found them.
