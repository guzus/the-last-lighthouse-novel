# The Memory Thief

## A Novel

## Part I: The Job

### Chapter 1: Wednesday Morning

I stole my first memory on a Wednesday.

Not because Wednesdays hold any particular magic—they don't. They're the forgettable middle child of the week, the day that exists only to remind you that Friday is still too far away. But that mundane invisibility was precisely why Victor chose it. "People's guards are down on Wednesdays," he explained, as if reading from some criminal psychology textbook. "Mondays they're vigilant, checking over their shoulders. Fridays they're distracted, already mentally at happy hour. But Wednesdays? Wednesdays they're just surviving, counting down the hours until Thursday makes the weekend feel within reach."

The target was a woman named Diane Fletcher. Fifty-three, divorced, worked in HR at a pharmaceutical company. Lived alone in a rent-controlled apartment in Queens with two cats named after Jane Austen characters. I knew all this because I'd been following her for six days, documenting her routines, her habits, the rhythm of her boring, predictable life.

I knew she got the same coffee every morning at 7:42 AM. Iced vanilla latte, extra shot, oat milk. I knew she sat in the same seat on the R train. I knew she microwaved fish for lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which made her coworkers hate her, though they never said it to her face.

What I didn't know was why Victor wanted her memory. He never told me why. That wasn't part of the job.

The extraction happened at 8:15 AM sharp, on the subway platform at Union Square. I bumped into her during the morning rush—nothing dramatic, just a gentle collision in the human tide flowing toward the turnstiles. "Sorry," I muttered, my hand already pressing the device hidden in my jacket pocket against her temple for exactly three seconds. To anyone watching, it looked like a phone. And in a city where everyone walks around glued to their screens, who would give it a second glance? But it was something else entirely. Something that defied every law of neuroscience and ethics. Something that shouldn't exist.

The tech had a dozen different names in the underground market. Neurosiphon. Mindwhisper. Ghost recorder. I just called it the Siphon. Press it against someone's temple for three seconds, and it captures everything. Not everything-everything, but close enough. Recent memories, emotional states, sensory impressions. The human brain is mostly electrical signals and chemical reactions. The Siphon just... records them.

Diane didn't even notice. Why would she? In New York, people bump into you every day. She just adjusted her bag and kept walking.

I felt the device vibrate twice in my pocket. Success.

Three hours later, I was in Victor's office in Midtown, watching him plug the Siphon into his computer. The office was exactly what you'd expect—glass and chrome, minimalist furniture, abstract art that probably cost more than my rent. Victor himself was less impressive. Mid-forties, thinning hair, expensive suit that didn't quite hide the gut. He looked like a hundred other guys you'd see grabbing lunch at Sweetgreen.

"Good work," he said, his eyes on the screen as data streamed across it. Code I didn't understand, patterns I couldn't read. "Clean extraction. No corruption."

"What are you going to do with it?" I asked.

He looked up, surprised. I never asked questions. That was rule number one. Do the job, take the money, don't ask questions.

"Why do you want to know?"

I shrugged. "Curiosity."

Victor studied me for a moment, then smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. "I'm going to sell it to her ex-husband. He wants to know if she ever loved him, or if she was faking it the whole time." He ejected the Siphon and handed it back to me. "Your cut is in the usual account. I'll have another job for you on Friday."

I took the train home to Brooklyn, the Siphon heavy in my pocket even though it was empty now. The money hit my account before I reached my station. Five thousand dollars. Not bad for twenty minutes of work.

But I couldn't stop thinking about Diane Fletcher and her boring, predictable life. About her ex-husband, whoever he was, downloading her memories like a pirated movie. About what he'd find in there—love or lies or something worse. The absolute certainty that he'd never be able to unknow it once he knew.

I got off at my stop and walked the six blocks to my apartment. It was raining, that miserable October drizzle that soaks through everything. I didn't have an umbrella. I never remembered to carry one.

When I got home, I did something I'd never done before.

I plugged the Siphon into my own computer and checked the backup files. The device automatically stored copies of everything it captured. Just in case. Victor didn't know about this feature—or if he did, he'd never mentioned it.

I opened Diane Fletcher's file and started reading her memories like a book.

That was my first mistake.

### Chapter 2: The Taste of Stolen Lives

Memory isn't like video playback—that's the first thing you learn when you steal one. It's messier, more organic, like trying to read a book where all the pages have been scattered and reassembled by someone with a loose understanding of narrative structure. When you access someone's extracted memories, you don't watch events unfold in neat chronological order with helpful timestamps. Instead, you get fragments. Impressions. Echoes of moments layered on top of each other like double-exposed photographs. The brain doesn't archive experiences in tidy filing cabinets—it's all associations and emotions and sensory details tangled together like Christmas lights stored in a box for too long.

Diane's memories tasted like burnt coffee and vanilla chapstick. They smelled like her mother's perfume and cat litter and the specific chemical scent of the office photocopier. I experienced her morning commute not as something observed but as something felt—the subway pole sticky under her palm, the guy next to her breathing too loud, the flicker of anxiety about the 10 AM meeting with her boss.

And I saw her marriage.

Not all of it. The Siphon only grabbed recent stuff, maybe the last few weeks. But the brain is associative. Recent thoughts link to old memories. When Diane thought about her morning coffee, she also thought about how her ex-husband used to make it for her, before things fell apart. When she looked at her phone, she saw his contact info still saved under "Michael ❤️" even though they'd been divorced for two years.

She had loved him. That was the thing. She'd loved him completely, stupidly, the kind of love that makes you ignore red flags and rationalize bad behavior. But love isn't enough. I saw memories of him coming home late, smelling like someone else's perfume. Saw him gaslighting her, making her feel crazy for being suspicious. Saw the moment she found the credit card statements for the hotel rooms.

And I saw what came after. The divorce. The therapy. The slow, painful process of rebuilding herself into someone who could function alone. The nights she cried into her pillow while Mr. Darcy and Emma purred beside her, oblivious. The mornings she woke up and forgot, just for a second, that he was gone, and then remembered all over again.

Michael—whoever he was—wanted to know if she'd loved him.

The answer was yes. She had loved him, and he'd destroyed that love systematically, methodically, until nothing remained but scar tissue and trust issues.

And now he wanted to rifle through her brain to see if it had been "real."

I closed the file and sat in the dark of my apartment, listening to my upstairs neighbor's terrible taste in music bleeding through the ceiling. I felt sick. Not physically sick, but soul sick. Like I'd done something I couldn't take back.

The rational part of my brain said: You're being ridiculous. You've been doing this for eight months. Why does this one matter?

The honest part of my brain said: Because you looked. Because you made it real.

I'd done forty-seven extractions for Victor. Forty-seven people's memories stolen and sold for purposes I never asked about. I'd told myself it didn't matter. They never knew. What they didn't know couldn't hurt them. The money was good. Better than good. I was paying off my student loans years ahead of schedule. I had health insurance for the first time since I graduated. I was surviving in a city that crushed people like me every single day.

But now I'd looked inside, and I couldn't unknow what I'd seen.

My phone buzzed. Text from Victor: "Friday's job. Same protocol. Details tomorrow."

I stared at the message for a long time. Then I did something either very brave or very stupid.

I texted back: "I'm out."

The reply came instantly: "We should talk. Tomorrow, 10 AM, my office."

I didn't respond. I turned off my phone, unplugged my computer, and lay down on my bed fully clothed. Outside, the rain kept falling, washing October down the gutters toward the sea.

I didn't sleep.

### Chapter 3: Exit Interview

Victor's office looked different in the morning light. Less impressive. The abstract art on the walls was the kind you could buy at HomeGoods. The view was half-blocked by the building next door. Without the carefully curated evening lighting, it was just another overpriced Midtown rental trying too hard to seem important.

Victor himself looked tired. There were shadows under his eyes that I'd never noticed before.

"Coffee?" he offered, gesturing to a French press on his desk.

"No thanks."

"Suit yourself." He poured himself a cup and took a sip, studying me over the rim. "So. You want out."

"Yeah."

"Can I ask why?"

"Personal reasons."

He smiled. Same smile as yesterday. Not nice. "Riley, I've known you for eight months. You don't have personal reasons. You barely have a personal life. You go to work, you go home, you do jobs for me. That's it."

"Maybe I want to change that."

"Maybe." He set down his cup. "Or maybe you did something you shouldn't have. Like looking at the data."

My stomach dropped, but I kept my face neutral. "I don't know what you mean."

"The Siphon has tracking software. I know every time someone accesses the files. I know you opened Diane Fletcher's memories at 11:47 PM yesterday." He leaned back in his chair. "I told you on day one: never look at the data. Never make it personal. You broke the rule."

"So fire me."

"I can't fire you, Riley. You know too much. You know what the tech does. You know who some of my clients are. You know this operation exists." He steepled his fingers. "People who quit don't just walk away. They become liabilities."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees. "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying we need to have an understanding. You want out? Fine. But you need to forget certain things first. Conveniently, I have the technology to make that happen."

My hands gripped the armrests of my chair. "You want to use the Siphon on me."

"I want to remove your memories of working for me. Clean extraction. You'll wake up thinking you spent the last eight months doing... I don't know, freelance graphic design or something. Whatever cover story you were using. The money in your account stays—I'm not a monster. But you won't remember how you earned it."

"No."

"It's not a negotiation."

I stood up. "I'm leaving."

Victor didn't move. "If you walk out that door with your memories intact, you become a security risk. I can't allow that. So your options are: voluntary extraction, or involuntary extraction. Your choice."

"You can't—"

"Can't I? How hard do you think it would be to stage a mugging in Brooklyn? You get hit on the head, wake up in the hospital with some missing time. Happens every day." He picked up his coffee again. "I like you, Riley. I really do. You're good at the work. That's why I'm offering you the choice. Voluntary is cleaner. Safer. You won't even remember being scared right now."

I thought about running. I thought about screaming. I thought about a dozen things that wouldn't work.

Instead, I said, "How do I know you'll stop at eight months? How do I know you won't just... erase whatever you want?"

"Because I'm a businessman, not a supervillain. I only remove what creates risk for me. Everything else stays." He opened a desk drawer and pulled out a consent form. Actual paper, like this was a dental appointment. "Sign this, and we do the procedure right now. Thirty minutes, and you walk out of here free. No obligations, no threats. You never hear from me again."

I looked at the form. Standard liability waiver language. "Not responsible for side effects including but not limited to headaches, disorientation, mood changes, altered sense of self..."

"There won't be side effects. The tech is clean."

"How do you know?"

"Because I've done this before." He said it matter-of-factly, like he was talking about filing taxes. "You're not my first employee to develop a conscience."

My hand shook as I picked up the pen. I thought about Diane Fletcher and her burnt coffee memories. I thought about the other forty-six people whose lives I'd invaded. I thought about who I'd be without the last eight months—all that money, all those crimes, all that guilt erased like it never happened.

Part of me wanted it. Wanted the clean slate, the fresh start, the chance to be ignorant again.

But the part of me that had stayed up all night reading a stranger's stolen love story said: No. You don't get to unknow this. You don't get to forget what you did.

I set down the pen. "There's a third option."

Victor raised an eyebrow. "I'm listening."

"I work for you, but different. Not as an extractor. As insurance. You said it yourself—people who quit become liabilities. But people who stay loyal are assets." I kept my voice steady even though my heart was trying to escape my chest. "I know your operation. I know how the tech works. That makes me valuable, right? So use me. Give me a different role. Something that doesn't involve stealing memories."

"Such as?"

"Quality control. Testing new devices. Research. I don't know—I'm sure you have other projects." I was making this up as I went, grasping at anything that might work. "The point is, I stay in the organization. You don't have to worry about me talking. I don't have to worry about you erasing my brain. Everybody wins."

Victor was quiet for a long moment. Then he laughed. Actually laughed, a genuine sound of surprise. "That's pretty good. Most people just beg or cry."

"Is that a yes?"

"It's a maybe." He closed the desk drawer, consent form disappearing. "I do have another project. Something experimental. I could use someone with your skill set. But it's... complicated."

"More complicated than stealing people's memories?"

"Different complicated." He stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the mediocre view. "What do you know about memory implantation?"

"Implantation? Like, putting memories in instead of taking them out?"

"Exactly like that." He turned back to me. "The Siphon is first-generation tech. It's crude. Effective, but crude. What we're working on now is more sophisticated. Not just recording memories, but editing them. Changing them. Creating new ones from scratch."

I felt cold again. "Why would anyone want that?"

"Why wouldn't they? Think about it, Riley. Trauma victims who want to remember their past differently. People with dementia who want to preserve their identity. Rich assholes who want to implant fake memories of achievements they never earned." He smiled. "The applications are endless. And the money is even better than what you've been making."

"That's... that's insane."

"That's the future." He sat back down. "So here's my offer. You work on the implantation project. Testing, quality control, whatever needs doing. Same pay as before, better hours, no more field work. You keep your memories. I keep my insurance. We both move forward."

I should have said no. I should have run out of that office and never looked back. But I was twenty-six years old with sixty thousand in student debt and a lease I couldn't break, living in a city that would chew me up and spit me out if I couldn't make rent.

And maybe, some small sick part of me wanted to know what came next. Wanted to see how deep this rabbit hole went.

"Okay," I said. "I'm in."

Victor smiled. This time it almost looked genuine. "Welcome to Project Revise."

## Part II: The Implant

### Chapter 4: Lab Rats

The lab was in Long Island City, disguised as a medical supply warehouse. From the outside, it looked exactly like the kind of place where you'd store bedpans and hospital gowns. Inside, it looked like a sci-fi movie had thrown up on a dentist's office.

Dr. Sarah Chen ran the operation. She was thirty-eight, Chinese-American, with a PhD in neuroscience from MIT and what I would later learn was a truly spectacular collection of vintage band t-shirts. The day I met her, she was wearing Pixies.

"You're the new QA?" she asked, looking up from a computer screen filled with brain scans.

"I guess."

"You guess, or you know?" She had the kind of direct stare that made you want to either confess everything or run away. "Victor doesn't do guesses."

"I know," I corrected. "I'm the new QA."

"Great. Ever worked with neural interface technology before?"

"No."

"Ever studied neuroscience?"

"No."

"Computer science? Electrical engineering? Advanced origami?"

"I have a BA in English Literature."

Dr. Chen closed her eyes and took a deep breath. "Of course you do. Victor sends me an English major to help with cutting-edge brain science. Perfect. Just perfect."

"I'm a fast learner," I offered.

"You'll need to be." She stood up and gestured for me to follow. "Come on. I'll show you what we're working with."

The lab proper was in the back, past three locked doors that required both key cards and thumbprints. Inside, it looked like a combination between a hospital and a recording studio. Banks of computers, monitoring equipment, and in the center, something that looked like a cross between a dentist's chair and an electric chair.

"This is the Revision Chamber," Dr. Chen said. "Terrible name. I voted for NeuroEdit Suite, but the marketing people overruled me. Anyway, this is where we implant the memories."

I approached the chair slowly. It looked innocuous and terrifying at the same time. "How does it work?"

"Long explanation or short explanation?"

"Medium?"

"Fair enough." She picked up what looked like a high-tech headband with sensors attached. "The human brain is basically a biological computer. Memories are stored as patterns of neural connections. The Siphon that you're familiar with reads those patterns. The Revision Chamber writes new ones."

"You're programming brains."

"In extremely simplified terms, yes. We create a memory template—essentially a script of what the person should remember. Then we use targeted electromagnetic stimulation to create the neural pathways that correspond to that memory. The brain does the rest. It fills in details, adds emotional context, makes it feel real."

"That's impossible."

"And yet." She gestured around the lab. "It's slow, imprecise, and fails about thirty percent of the time. But when it works, it works perfectly. The subject can't tell the difference between an implanted memory and a real one."

I thought about Diane Fletcher's memories, the taste of burnt coffee and broken love. "That's horrifying."

"That's science." Dr. Chen sat down at one of the computers. "Your job is to help me improve the success rate. We need to test different template structures, different stimulation patterns, different subject profiles. Find out what works and what doesn't."

"Test on who?"

"Volunteers. Paid participants. They know what they're signing up for." She pulled up a file on the screen. "This is Subject Twelve. Real name redacted. Twenty-four years old, male, no pre-existing neurological conditions. We implanted a memory of eating breakfast at a diner that doesn't exist. He remembers it perfectly. Describes the taste of the coffee, the color of the waitress's uniform, the song playing on the jukebox. None of it happened."

I stared at the brain scans, the data charts, the clinical notes. "What's the point? Why would someone want a fake memory?"

Dr. Chen looked at me like I'd asked why someone would want money. "Riley, do you remember your childhood?"

"Of course."

"Good memories? Bad memories?"

"Mix of both."

"Now imagine you could edit out the bad ones. Keep the good, delete the bad. Imagine someone who was abused as a child—they could replace those memories with something better. Someone who lost a loved one could implant memories of a goodbye they never got to say. Someone with PTSD could overwrite the trauma." She turned back to the screen. "That's the point. Therapeutic revision. Giving people the past they needed instead of the past they got."

It sounded noble when she said it like that. It sounded like helping people.

It also sounded like the worst idea in human history.

"When do I start?" I asked.

### Chapter 5: Subject Nineteen

Her name was Maya, and she wanted to remember learning to ride a bike.

Not just any bike memory—a specific one. Her father teaching her, patient and encouraging, running beside her in the park on a sunny afternoon. The kind of Norman Rockwell moment that defined good childhoods.

The problem was, it never happened. Maya's father died when she was three. She never learned to ride a bike as a kid. She taught herself as an adult, alone, falling repeatedly on the empty parking lot behind her apartment building.

Now she was thirty-one, in therapy for depression, and her therapist had suggested that maybe—maybe—a positive childhood memory might help. Someone in her support group knew someone who knew Victor. And Victor knew Dr. Chen.

And now Maya was in the Revision Chamber, sensors attached to her head, while I sat at the monitoring station with Dr. Chen.

"Template is loaded," Dr. Chen murmured, fingers flying across the keyboard. "Neural pathway mapping looks good. Initiating sequence in three... two... one..."

The machines hummed. On the screens, I watched Maya's brain activity light up like a city at night. Specific regions firing in specific patterns, chemical reactions cascading through neural networks, the architecture of experience being built from nothing.

It took forty-five minutes.

When it was done, Maya opened her eyes and smiled. "Did it work?"

"Tell me about learning to ride a bike," Dr. Chen said.

Maya's smile widened. "My dad taught me. I was six. We went to Riverside Park, and he ran beside me holding the seat. He let go, and I didn't even notice at first. I was so focused on pedaling. And then I heard him cheering behind me, and I realized I was doing it. I was riding." Her eyes were distant, seeing something that never happened. "He was so proud. He took me for ice cream after. Mint chocolate chip."

Dr. Chen made notes. "How do you feel?"

"Happy." Maya's voice cracked. "I feel happy. Is that weird?"

"Not at all." Dr. Chen helped her out of the chair. "Rest for thirty minutes. Drink water. If you experience any headaches or disorientation, let me know immediately."

After Maya left the room, I turned to Dr. Chen. "She really believes it."

"Of course she believes it. To her brain, it's real. The memory exists in the exact same way all her other memories exist. Same neural structures, same chemical markers." She pulled up the brain scan data. "You see this? That's a memory formation identical to natural memory formation. Perfect integration."

"But it's a lie."

"It's a therapeutic intervention." Dr. Chen's voice was patient, like she'd had this conversation before. "Maya needed a positive paternal memory. Now she has one. Will it cure her depression? Probably not. But it might help. And what's the harm? Her father is dead. He can't be hurt by this. She gets a happy memory she didn't have before."

"The harm is that it's not true."

"Riley, do you remember your fifth birthday party?"

The change of subject threw me. "Vaguely?"

"Do you remember it accurately? Every detail exactly as it happened? Or do you remember the story you've told yourself about it? The narrative you've constructed from fragments and photos and things people told you later?" Dr. Chen leaned back in her chair. "All memory is reconstruction. Every time you remember something, your brain rebuilds it from pieces, and those pieces change. Add details, lose details, shift the emotional context. What we're doing isn't that different. We're just more direct about it."

I wanted to argue. I wanted to explain the difference between natural memory drift and literally programming fake experiences into someone's head. But I couldn't find the words.

Maya came back twenty minutes later, still smiling. She paid in cash—three thousand dollars. Victor's fee. She shook Dr. Chen's hand and thanked her profusely. "You have no idea what this means to me," she said.

After she left, I sat in the quiet lab, listening to the computers hum.

"How many have you done?" I asked Dr. Chen. "Total?"

"Eighteen. Nineteen counting Maya."

"And they all worked?"

"Define worked. Nineteen people received implanted memories. Sixteen integrated successfully. Three rejected—the brain can tell sometimes, flags it as false. They just felt confused and weird. We refunded their money."

"What kind of memories? All like Maya's?"

Dr. Chen pulled up a file directory. Subject One through Subject Eighteen, each with a clinical summary. "Various. Couple of goodbye memories—people who lost loved ones suddenly. One woman wanted to remember her wedding day differently, the version where her mother was still alive to attend. One guy wanted memories of being good at sports in high school." She scrolled down. "Subject Fourteen wanted to remember being confident and popular as a teenager. Subject Sixteen wanted to remember standing up to his abusive stepfather."

"Did any of them seem... wrong to you?"

She was quiet for a moment. "Wrong isn't a scientific term."

"Dr. Chen."

"Sarah. If we're going to have moral crises together, you should call me Sarah." She closed the file directory. "Do they seem wrong? Sometimes. Yes. I got into neuroscience to help people with Alzheimer's, PTSD, traumatic brain injuries. This wasn't what I imagined. But it is helping people. I tell myself that every day. These people come here broken, and they leave happier. Isn't that worth something?"

"Even if it's based on a lie?"

"Even then." She met my eyes. "What's the alternative? They stay broken? They live with pain that doesn't have to exist? We have the technology to help. Using it seems like the ethical choice."

I thought about Diane Fletcher again. About her ex-husband downloading her memories to verify her love. About the difference between reading someone's truth and writing someone's fiction.

"When's the next subject?" I asked.

"Tomorrow. Subject Twenty. Should be interesting—he wants something more complex than what we've done before." Sarah pulled up the file. "Multiple related memories, covering years of history. Remembering a best friend who never existed."

"Why would anyone want that?"

"Because he's lonely, Riley. Because he grew up isolated and miserable and wants to remember being less alone." She looked at me. "Are you going to help, or are you going to quit?"

I should have quit. I should have walked out right then.

Instead I said, "I'll help."

"Good. Be here at nine. And Riley?" She gave me a tired smile. "Welcome to the moral gray area. Population: us."

### Chapter 6: The Friend Who Never Was

Subject Twenty's name was Aaron. Twenty-nine years old, software engineer, lived in Jersey City. He wore a Zelda t-shirt and had anxious eyes that reminded me of a shelter dog waiting to be adopted.

"I know this sounds pathetic," he said as Sarah prepped the equipment. "But I looked at the other options—therapy, antidepressants, support groups—and they didn't work. So I thought, why not this?"

"Tell me about the friend you want to remember," Sarah said.

"His name is—would be—Jake. We met in middle school. I was the weird kid who liked video games and reading, and he was the same, so we clicked. We'd hang out every day after school. Play games, talk about nothing, just... exist together." Aaron's voice was wistful. "He moved away in high school, but we stayed in touch. Emails, calls, visits when we could. Just knowing he existed made everything easier."

"This is a big implant," Sarah warned. "Years of memories, not just one moment. It's going to take longer, and the failure rate is higher."

"I understand."

"And you know that Jake won't exist outside your head, right? You can't call him. He won't have social media. You'll just have the memories."

"I know." Aaron looked down at his hands. "But right now I don't even have that. I have nothing. At least this way I'll remember having someone."

I watched from the monitoring station as Sarah initialized the sequence. The template for "Jake" was complex—a personality constructed from Aaron's specifications, dozens of memories spanning fifteen years, complete with inside jokes and emotional progression and the texture of long friendship.

It took three hours.

Aaron stayed conscious through all of it, answering Sarah's questions to help guide the implantation. "What did Jake's voice sound like?" "What games did you play together?" "How did you feel when he moved away?" His answers became the building blocks of a person who never breathed.

When it was done, Aaron looked exhausted and happy. "I can remember him," he said, wonder in his voice. "I can see his face. I can hear him laughing at my terrible jokes. God, I forgot—I mean, I remember now—he had this awful laugh. Like a car that won't start."

Sarah made him rest, ran the standard tests, checked for integration errors. Everything looked clean.

Aaron left with a smile and three thousand dollars less in his bank account. He left alone, but in his head, he had a best friend.

I helped Sarah clean up the equipment in silence.

"Say it," she finally said. "Whatever you're thinking, just say it."

"That was the saddest thing I've ever seen."

"Sad that he needed it, or sad that we provided it?"

"Both. Neither. I don't know." I sat down heavily. "He paid three grand to hallucinate a friendship. That's not helping him. That's enabling his isolation."

"Is it?" Sarah challenged. "Studies show that people with strong social memories—even if those relationships are gone—have better mental health outcomes than people who've always been alone. Memory of connection is protective. We just gave Aaron fifteen years of protective memories."

"Fake memories."

"His brain doesn't know that." She started shutting down the computers. "Look, I'm not saying this is perfect. I'm not even saying it's good. But Aaron tried everything else and nothing worked. This worked. He walked out of here happier than when he walked in. Isn't that the point of medicine? First, do no harm. Second, reduce suffering."

"You really believe that?"

She was quiet for a long time. "I'm trying to," she said finally. "I'm really, really trying to."

We locked up the lab and walked to the subway together. It was November now, the city dark by five PM, everyone hunched against the cold.

"Can I ask you something?" Sarah said as we waited for the train. "Why did you take this job? Victor said you used to do field work. Extractions. That pays better than QA."

I thought about Diane Fletcher, about looking inside her stolen memories. About running from one moral compromise straight into another.

"I wanted to stop stealing," I said.

Sarah laughed, bitter and sharp. "And instead you're helping me write fiction into people's brains. That's not better, Riley. It's just different."

The train arrived, screeching and bright. We got on, found seats, rode in silence toward our separate homes.

I thought about Aaron and his imaginary best friend. About Maya and her father who never taught her to ride a bike. About all the people who would come after them, wanting memories of lives they never lived.

And I thought about the people whose memories I'd stolen. Forty-seven extractions. Forty-seven people who never knew I'd been inside their heads.

At least implantation was voluntary. At least these people knew what they were buying.

It was a small comfort, but I held onto it like a life raft in a dark ocean.

My stop came. I got off, walked home, climbed the stairs to my apartment.

I didn't sleep well that night either.

## Part III: The Mistake

### Chapter 7: Recursion

Three months into Project Revise, we'd done sixty-two implantations. Success rate was up to seventy-eight percent. Sarah was talking about publishing our findings—in carefully redacted form—in a neuroscience journal. Victor was talking about expanding the operation, opening facilities in other cities.

I was having nightmares.

Not every night. Just three or four times a week. Dreams where I couldn't tell which memories were mine and which were implanted. Dreams where I woke up in the Revision Chamber with Sarah standing over me, telling me that my whole life was a template, that Riley Walsh was just a construct, that nothing I remembered had ever happened.

I started writing things down. Stupid stuff. "I am twenty-six years old. I grew up in Pennsylvania. My mother's name is Linda. My first dog was named Chester." Proof that I existed, that my memories were mine.

Sarah noticed the notebook at work.

"You okay?" she asked.

"Fine."

"Riley."

"I'm fine. Just tired."

"You're having integration anxiety. It's common for people who work with memory tech. You start questioning your own memories because you spend all day watching us build fake ones." She closed the file she'd been reading. "Take a few days off. Go visit your mom. Ground yourself in real memories."

"I can't. We've got six subjects scheduled this week."

"And I can handle them alone. I did before you got here." She gave me a look that was half concern, half command. "Take. Time. Off. That's an order from your supervisor."

So I went home to Pennsylvania for the first time in a year.

My mother still lived in the same house where I grew up. Same floral wallpaper, same creaky stairs, same smell of whatever complicated dinner she was making. She answered the door and immediately hugged me. "You look terrible," she said. "Are you eating?"

"Yes, Mom."

"Are you sleeping?"

"Mostly."

"Mostly isn't yes." She pulled me inside. "Come on. I made pot roast. Tell me about work."

I couldn't tell her about work. I'd told her I was doing medical research, which was technically true. So instead I told her generic stories about lab life, difficult colleagues, boring procedures.

She listened with the patient expression of someone who knows you're lying but loves you anyway.

After dinner, we sat in the living room drinking tea. On the mantle were photos—me at various ages, gap-toothed and awkward and young. My high school graduation. My college graduation. The documented proof of a life lived.

"Do you remember teaching me to ride a bike?" I asked suddenly.

Mom looked surprised. "Of course. You were seven. Stubborn as hell. Refused training wheels. Crashed into Mrs. Patterson's rosebushes twice."

"Do you remember it exactly? Or do you remember the story of it?"

She thought about this. "Both, I suppose. Why?"

"Just wondering how memory works."

"Well, I have photographic evidence if you need proof." She pulled out an album—actual physical photos, pre-smartphone era. There I was, seven years old, helmet askew, bike too big for me. My dad in the background, laughing. "See? Rosebushes. And there's the scar on your knee from the second crash."

I touched my knee automatically. The scar was still there, faint but real. Physical evidence of a memory.

"Riley, what's this really about?" Mom asked gently.

"Do you ever wish you could change the past? Remember things differently than how they happened?"

She was quiet for a moment. "Sometimes. Your father and I—we had some bad years before the divorce. Sometimes I wish I could remember only the good parts. The falling in love, not the falling apart." She looked at the photos. "But I don't think I'd actually want to change it. The bad memories made me who I am just as much as the good ones. Maybe more."

"Even though they hurt?"

"Even though they hurt." She took my hand. "What's going on, sweetheart? Did something happen?"

I wanted to tell her. Wanted to explain the whole thing—the extractions, the implantations, the lab where we rewrote people's histories like software updates. But I couldn't. So instead I said, "I think I might be in over my head with this job."

"Then quit."

"It's not that simple."

"It never is." Mom squeezed my hand. "But Riley, I've known you your whole life. All twenty-six years. Every memory, good and bad. And I know that when you feel like you're compromising yourself, you get that look. The same look you have right now."

"What look?"

"Like you're trying to justify something you know is wrong."

I felt tears prick my eyes. "What if I'm already in too deep to quit?"

"Then you figure out how to get out anyway. Because the alternative is living with that look forever, and you deserve better."

I stayed for three days. Helped Mom clean out the garage. Visited my old high school. Walked past Mrs. Patterson's house with its rosebushes. Touched the scar on my knee and remembered falling.

Real memories. My memories. No one could take them or change them or write over them.

When I got back to New York, I found the lab in chaos.

### Chapter 8: Cascade Failure

"What happened?" I asked, finding Sarah surrounded by screens full of error messages.

"Subject Fifty-Seven. Complete cascade failure. The implant not only didn't integrate—it corrupted existing memories." She pulled up brain scans that looked wrong, neural pathways misfiring like a circuit board shorting out. "He came in wanting to remember a happy childhood. Simple template, we've done dozens like it. But something went wrong during the integration. His brain rejected the implant and... glitched."

"Glitched? People don't glitch."

"His memory does now. He can't remember the last five years. Just gone. His brain is treating everything from 2019 onward as corrupted data and refusing to access it." Sarah's hands shook as she typed. "He doesn't remember his current job, his apartment, his girlfriend. He thinks he's still in college. He's twenty-nine years old, and the last thing he remembers is being twenty-four."

I felt cold. "Where is he now?"

"Hospital. We had to call it in as a neurological event. Stroke-like symptoms. Victor is handling the situation."

"Handling it how?"

She didn't answer.

I grabbed my coat. "Which hospital?"

"Riley, don't—"

"Which hospital?"

"NYU Langone. But you can't go there. If anyone connects him to us—"

I was already leaving.

Subject Fifty-Seven's real name was Marcus Chen. No relation to Sarah, just bad luck. I found him in a private room on the neurology ward, hooked up to monitors, staring at the ceiling with confused eyes.

A woman sat beside his bed, holding his hand. She looked exhausted.

"Are you family?" I asked from the doorway.

She looked up. "I'm his girlfriend. Who are you?"

"A friend from college," I lied. "I heard he was here. What happened?"

"They don't know. He collapsed at work. When he woke up, he thought it was 2019. He doesn't remember me. We've been together for three years, and he doesn't remember me." Her voice cracked. "The doctors keep running tests, but they can't find anything. No stroke, no tumor, no explanation."

Marcus turned his head toward us. "Sarah?" he said to his girlfriend.

"It's Jennifer," she said, patient and heartbroken.

"Sorry. You look like someone I knew." He looked at me. "Do I know you?"

"No," I said honestly. "I don't think so."

I left before I did something stupid like tell the truth.

Outside the hospital, I called Sarah. "This is bad."

"I know."

"We did this to him. We broke his brain."

"It was a malfunction. A one-in-a-million error. We've done sixty-two successful procedures—"

"And this is number sixty-three. What happens when there's a number sixty-four? Sixty-five? How many people are we going to break?"

Sarah was quiet. Then: "Victor wants to see us. Both of us. Tonight."

"Why?"

"Because Marcus's girlfriend is asking questions. Because the hospital is running neurological panels that might show evidence of electromagnetic stimulation. Because this could expose everything." She paused. "And because Victor has a solution."

"What kind of solution?"

"The kind where we use the Siphon to extract Marcus's last five years of memories and give them back to him."

I closed my eyes. "That's not how it works. You can't just copy-paste memories from outside storage into someone's brain."

"Actually, we can. It's experimental. The technology is unstable. But it's theoretically possible."

"Theoretically."

"Riley, we don't have a lot of options here. Either we try to fix what we broke, or we let Marcus spend the rest of his life missing five years. What would you choose?"

I thought about Jennifer, holding the hand of a boyfriend who didn't remember her. I thought about Marcus, trapped in 2019, the present stolen from him.

I thought about every choice I'd made that led me here.

"I'll be there in thirty minutes," I said.

### Chapter 9: The Repair

Victor's solution involved equipment I'd never seen before. New devices, experimental tech, things that Dr. Sarah Chen looked at with equal parts fascination and horror.

"This is the Memory Bridge," Victor explained, gesturing to a device that looked like two Siphons connected by a thick cable. "It allows direct memory transfer from storage media into a living brain. We've been developing it as the next phase of Project Revise."

"You tested this on humans?" Sarah asked.

"Lab animals first. Then limited human trials. The success rate is about sixty percent."

"Sixty percent?" I stared at him. "What happens the other forty percent?"

"Various outcomes. Some subjects experience severe headaches. Some reject the transfer. Some..." He paused. "Some experience personality fragmentation."

"Meaning what?"

"Meaning the introduced memories don't fully integrate with their sense of self. They remember events but feel disconnected from them. Like watching someone else's life on video."

Sarah was already shaking her head. "We can't use this on Marcus. It's too risky."

"We don't have a choice," Victor said calmly. "His girlfriend is threatening to sue the hospital for malpractice. If they dig deeper, they'll find the electromagnetic exposure patterns. They'll trace it to the lab. Everything we've built will collapse."

"So we risk turning him into a vegetable to cover our asses?" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "He didn't consent to being a test subject for experimental technology."

"He consented when he signed the waiver for the initial procedure. There's a clause about corrective measures in case of complications." Victor pulled out his phone, typed something, showed me the screen. "Right there. 'Patient agrees to necessary interventions to address adverse events.' Legally, we're covered."

"Legally isn't the same as ethically."

"No. But it's a lot more defensible in court." He looked between Sarah and me. "Here's what's going to happen. We're going to visit Marcus. I'm going to offer him a choice—try the experimental procedure, or live with the memory loss. If he consents, we do the transfer. If it works, everyone wins. If it doesn't..." He shrugged. "We tried."

"And if he doesn't consent?" Sarah asked.

"Then we've documented his refusal of treatment, and whatever happens next isn't our responsibility." Victor's phone buzzed. He glanced at it. "Jennifer just filed a complaint with the hospital. We need to move. Now."

We went back to NYU Langone at midnight. Victor had credentials that got us into Marcus's room—fake doctor ID, probably. Marcus was awake, staring at his phone with a confused expression.

"This isn't my phone," he said when he saw us. "I mean, it is, but it's not. All my apps are different. There are photos of people I don't know. Texts from someone named Jennifer who says she's my girlfriend." He looked up. "What happened to me?"

Victor launched into a practiced explanation. Experimental treatment gone wrong. Temporary memory disruption. Potential solution using cutting-edge technology. He made it sound reasonable, medical, like this was a standard neurological procedure and not a desperate cover-up.

Marcus listened with the intensity of someone clinging to hope.

"Will I remember the last five years?" he asked.

"If the procedure works, yes. All of it." Victor didn't mention the sixty percent success rate. Didn't mention personality fragmentation or the test animals that died in the trials.

"What if it doesn't work?"

"Then you continue with standard neurological rehabilitation. Work with therapists to rebuild your recent history through photos, stories, records. It's slower, but it's effective."

Marcus looked at his phone again. At Jennifer's texts. "I love you," one of them said. "Please remember me."

"Okay," Marcus said. "Let's try it."

We moved him to the lab at 2 AM, while the hospital was quiet and understaffed. Victor had paperwork that authorized a transfer to a private facility. Everything looked legitimate because Victor was very, very good at his job.

In the lab, Sarah prepared the Memory Bridge with shaking hands. I helped Marcus into the Revision Chamber—now being used for a purpose it was never designed for.

"This is insane," Sarah whispered to me. "We should stop. We should tell him the truth."

"And then what? He's already here. His life is already broken. At least this gives him a chance."

"A sixty percent chance."

"Better than zero."

Sarah closed her eyes, took a breath, nodded. She loaded the template—not a constructed fiction this time, but actual neural data from Marcus's brain. The last five years, painstakingly mapped from his corrupted memory centers, reconstructed from electrical patterns and chemical signatures.

"Ready?" she asked Marcus.

He nodded. He looked terrified and hopeful and young.

Sarah initiated the sequence.

The Memory Bridge hummed to life. On the monitors, I watched as data streamed from storage into Marcus's brain. Five years of life, compressed into electrical signals, flowing through neurons like water through pipes.

It took ninety minutes.

Ninety minutes of watching Marcus's face twitch and shift as memories poured into him. Ninety minutes of monitoring his vital signs, watching for cascade failure or rejection or any of the dozen things that could go wrong.

At minute seventy-three, his eyes opened.

"Marcus?" Sarah said carefully. "How do you feel?"

He blinked. Looked around the lab. Looked at his hands. "I... I remember. The job. The apartment. Jennifer. I remember all of it."

"What year is it?" Victor asked.

"2024. November. I'm twenty-nine. I came here because I wanted to remember being happy as a kid, and something went wrong." He looked at us. "You fixed it. You actually fixed it."

Sarah ran the neural scans. Clean integration. No corruption. The procedure had worked.

We were the luckiest people alive.

"We'll need to monitor you for a few days," Victor said, already typing on his phone. "But preliminary results look good. Congratulations, Marcus. You got your life back."

Marcus smiled. It looked genuine. "Thank you. Really. Thank you."

We returned him to the hospital as dawn broke over New York. Official story: spontaneous recovery. It happened sometimes with neurological events. Medical miracle.

Jennifer was waiting. When Marcus said her name—really said it, with recognition and love—she burst into tears and held him like she'd never let go.

I watched through the doorway. Watched them reunite. Watched Marcus remember his life and his girlfriend and everything he'd nearly lost.

"See?" Victor said quietly, standing beside me. "We did a good thing."

"We broke him and then fixed him. That's not good. That's just less bad."

"In this world, less bad is the best we get." He handed me an envelope. "Your cut. Hazard pay for the emergency procedure. Take a week off. You look exhausted."

I took the envelope without opening it. "How many more, Victor? How many more mistakes before we can't fix them?"

"As many as it takes," he said. "Until the technology is perfect, or until someone stops us. Whichever comes first."

He walked away, leaving me standing in the hospital corridor, watching Marcus and Jennifer hold each other.

I should have felt relief. Marcus was okay. The procedure worked. Crisis averted.

Instead, I felt like I was standing on the edge of a cliff, looking down into darkness, knowing that eventually I would fall.

## Part IV: The Truth

### Chapter 10: The Visitor

Her name was Dr. Rebecca Hawthorn, and she showed up at the lab on a Tuesday in December with FBI credentials and questions we couldn't answer.

"Dr. Chen?" she said, flashing her badge. "I'm with the Bureau's Cybercrime Division. I need to ask you about a patient named Marcus Chen."

Sarah's face went pale, but her voice stayed steady. "I'm sorry, who?"

"Marcus Chen. Twenty-nine years old. Experienced catastrophic memory loss and spontaneous recovery at NYU Langone three weeks ago. Hospital records show electromagnetic exposure patterns consistent with neural interface technology." Dr. Hawthorn pulled out a tablet, showed Sarah brain scans. "Technology that, according to our research, doesn't exist commercially. Which means someone is operating outside regulatory oversight."

I was in the monitoring room, watching through the security camera. My hand hovered over my phone, ready to call Victor.

Sarah didn't break. "I run a neuroscience research lab. We study memory formation. I don't work with patients."

"No? Then why did Marcus's phone GPS place him at this address the night before his recovery?" Dr. Hawthorn walked deeper into the lab, looking around with professional curiosity. "And why do your power usage records show massive electrical consumption at 2:47 AM that same night? Enough to run medical equipment. Specifically, equipment that generates controlled electromagnetic fields."

"We run experiments—"

"On human subjects? Without FDA approval? Without IRB oversight?" Dr. Hawthorn turned back to Sarah. "Dr. Chen, I've been investigating memory modification technology for two years. I know it exists. I know there are underground labs offering services that range from memory extraction to implantation. And I know Marcus Chen was in one of those labs. What I don't know is whether you're a victim or a perpetrator."

Sarah's professional mask cracked. "A victim?"

"Many of the researchers we've found are being coerced. Threats, blackmail, debt. If that's your situation, we can help. But I need you to talk to me."

I watched Sarah's face. Saw the exhaustion, the moral weight, the desperate calculation happening behind her eyes.

She was going to break. I could see it.

I called Victor.

"FBI at the lab," I said when he answered. "Asking about Marcus. They know."

Victor was quiet for exactly three seconds. "Get out. Both of you. Right now. Use the emergency exit. There's a car waiting two blocks east. Black sedan, plates GHX-7743."

"What about Dr. Hawthorn?"

"I'll handle her. Move. Now."

I ran into the lab. "Sarah, we have to go."

Dr. Hawthorn's hand went to her holster. "Nobody's going anywhere."

"There's been a mistake," I said, trying to sound calm. "Sarah doesn't know anything about Marcus Chen. I'm the one you want to talk to."

"Riley—" Sarah started.

"I'm the one who brought him here. Sarah just runs the lab. She doesn't know what I've been doing with the equipment." I looked at Dr. Hawthorn. "You want to arrest someone? Arrest me."

"Riley, what are you doing?" Sarah whispered.

Saving you, I thought. Or maybe dooming both of us. Hard to tell.

Dr. Hawthorn studied me. "What's your name?"

"Riley Walsh."

"And what exactly have you been doing with the equipment, Riley?"

Before I could answer, the lab's power cut out. Complete darkness, followed by emergency lights flickering on.

"What the hell—" Dr. Hawthorn started.

"Building maintenance," a voice said from the doorway. Victor, wearing a maintenance uniform, holding a clipboard. "Power surge in the electrical room. Everyone needs to evacuate while we check the systems. Safety protocol."

"I'm in the middle of an investigation," Dr. Hawthorn said.

"And I'm in the middle of preventing a fire hazard. You can investigate after we confirm the building won't explode." Victor gestured to the door. "This way, please."

Dr. Hawthorn didn't move. "Show me your credentials."

"Ma'am, I really need to insist—"

"Credentials. Now."

Victor sighed. Then he pulled out a gun.

"Everybody stays calm," he said, voice level. "Dr. Hawthorn, I'm going to need your service weapon, your badge, and your phone. Slowly."

"You're making this so much worse," Dr. Hawthorn said, but she complied. Put her gun, badge, and phone on the lab table. "You know I'm not alone, right? My partner knows where I am."

"Your partner is having car trouble three blocks away. Flat tire. These things happen." Victor picked up Dr. Hawthorn's belongings. "Riley, Sarah, secure her. We're moving to the contingency location."

"Victor, what are you doing?" Sarah's voice shook. "This is kidnapping a federal agent. This is—"

"This is survival. Riley, I said secure her."

I didn't move. "No."

Victor turned the gun toward me. "Riley."

"No. This has gone too far. Marcus, the FBI, now this? We're not criminals, Victor. We're—" I stopped. Looked at the gun, at Dr. Hawthorn, at Sarah. "What are we?"

"We're people with a choice," Victor said. "We can end this right now—erase Dr. Hawthorn's last few hours, let her wake up confused in her car, continue our work. Or we can let her arrest us, shut down the lab, destroy everything we've built. What's it going to be?"

Dr. Hawthorn laughed. Not a happy sound. "You can't erase my memory. I'm a federal agent. There are protocols, check-ins. I disappear for even an hour, and this building will be swarming with agents."

"Then we have an hour," Victor said. "Riley, for the last time. Help me, or get out of the way."

I thought about Diane Fletcher and her burnt coffee memories. About Maya and her father who never taught her to ride a bike. About Marcus and his five stolen years. About every choice that had led me to this moment, standing in a lab with a gun pointed at me, deciding who I wanted to be.

"I'm out of the way," I said, and stepped aside.

Victor smiled. "Smart choice."

Sarah made a small, broken sound.

Victor moved toward Dr. Hawthorn with the Siphon in his other hand—

And I grabbed the nearest piece of equipment and smashed it into his arm.

The gun went off. The bullet hit the ceiling. Victor dropped the Siphon, and Dr. Hawthorn moved—fast, professional, trained. She had Victor on the ground in three seconds, his arm twisted behind his back.

"Riley Walsh," she said, breathing hard, "I'm going to need you to give me a full statement. Everything. From the beginning."

Sarah sat down heavily in her chair. "We're so screwed."

"Probably," I agreed. "But at least we're not kidnappers."

Dr. Hawthorn's backup arrived six minutes later. They secured Victor, secured the lab, secured all the equipment and records. More agents than I could count, moving with practiced efficiency.

I sat in the Revision Chamber—ironic—and told Dr. Rebecca Hawthorn everything.

It took four hours.

### Chapter 11: Testimony

The FBI field office in New York was exactly what you'd expect. Fluorescent lights, uncomfortable chairs, bad coffee. I sat in an interview room with Dr. Hawthorn and her partner, a quiet man named Agent Torres, and confessed to eight months of memory crimes.

"Start with Victor," Dr. Hawthorn said. "How did you meet?"

So I told her. The extraction work, the Siphon, Diane Fletcher, the decision to quit that led to Project Revise. I left nothing out. Sixty-three implantation procedures. One catastrophic failure. One desperate repair. All of it.

Dr. Hawthorn took notes without judgment. "And the subjects—did they know what they were getting into?"

"They signed waivers. They paid money. They knew we were giving them artificial memories." I paused. "But they didn't know how experimental it was. How risky. Victor... he made it sound safe. Established. Like a normal medical procedure."

"What about the extractions? Before Project Revise."

I told her about the forty-seven people whose memories I'd stolen. Gave her every name I could remember, every detail. Diane Fletcher and her ex-husband. The others whose stories I didn't know because I'd never looked.

"That's felony unauthorized access to neural data," Agent Torres said. "Each count carries five to ten years."

"I know."

"Why confess? You could have walked away. Dr. Hawthorn didn't have anything on you specifically."

"Because I'm tired," I said honestly. "Tired of lying. Tired of pretending this is okay. Tired of watching people pay us to rewrite their brains because reality is too hard to face."

Dr. Hawthorn leaned forward. "Riley, I've been investigating this technology for two years. You're the first person on the inside who's been willing to talk. If you cooperate—full disclosure, testimony against Victor, help us understand the scope of the operation—we can work something out with the DA. Reduced charges, maybe immunity."

"What about Sarah?"

"What about her?"

"She didn't know about the extractions. That was before her time. And the implantations—she thought she was helping people. She believed it was therapeutic." I met Dr. Hawthorn's eyes. "She's not a criminal. She's a scientist who got in over her head."

"She performed unlicensed medical procedures on human subjects. That's criminal regardless of intent."

"Then I won't cooperate unless you give her immunity too."

Agent Torres raised an eyebrow. "You're not in a position to negotiate."

"Then I guess you'll have to build your case without my testimony. Good luck proving how the technology works without someone to explain it." I sat back. "Sarah gets immunity, or I say nothing. Your choice."

Dr. Hawthorn and Agent Torres exchanged a look. Some silent FBI communication I couldn't read.

"We'll talk to the DA," Dr. Hawthorn said finally. "No promises. But if Dr. Chen cooperates, if she testifies, we can probably work something out."

"Then I'll cooperate too."

They kept me in the field office for two more days. Taking statements, reviewing records, building the case against Victor. Sarah was in a different interview room, going through the same process.

On the third day, Dr. Hawthorn came to get me. "We found something," she said. "In Victor's records. A list of clients who purchased extracted memories."

She showed me a spreadsheet. Hundreds of names. Dates. Prices. Types of memories sold.

Diane Fletcher's ex-husband was there. Paid fifteen thousand dollars for "marital memory verification."

But there were others. So many others.

"This is bigger than we thought," Dr. Hawthorn said. "Victor wasn't just selling memories to individuals. He had corporate clients. Law firms buying memories for litigation. Companies buying employee memories for industrial espionage. Political groups buying opposition research from people's extracted thoughts."

I felt sick. "I helped him do this."

"You also helped us stop him." She closed the file. "The DA agreed to the deal. You and Dr. Chen get immunity in exchange for full cooperation. You testify against Victor and everyone on this client list. You help us understand the technology so we can regulate it. You do that, and you walk away."

"Just walk away? After everything I did?"

"You walk away with a record. Sealed, but still there. You'll never work in tech or healthcare again. You'll spend the next few years in witness protection while we prosecute the cases. And you'll live with the knowledge of what you did." Dr. Hawthorn's voice was firm but not unkind. "That's your punishment, Riley. Not prison. Conscience."

"What about the subjects? The people who got implanted memories?"

"We're contacting them. Offering them extraction of the artificial memories and psychological support. It's voluntary—if they want to keep the implants, they can. But they deserve to know the truth."

I thought about Maya and her father. About Aaron and his imaginary best friend. About all of them, living with memories that never happened.

"What about the extraction victims? The people whose memories were stolen?"

"That's harder. Most of them never knew it happened. Telling them might do more harm than good." Dr. Hawthorn paused. "But we're considering victim notification protocols. Let them decide if they want to know."

Diane Fletcher would get a call. Would learn that her ex-husband bought her memories. Would have to live with that violation.

I'd done that to her. To forty-six other people.

"When do I testify?" I asked.

"Trial starts in three months. Until then, you're in protective custody. Victor has... connections. People who won't be happy about this investigation." She stood. "Pack your things. Marshals will move you to a safe house tomorrow."

"Can I see Sarah?"

"Brief goodbye. Supervised."

They brought Sarah to a conference room. She looked exhausted, older than her thirty-eight years. We sat across from each other with a federal agent standing by the door.

"We did a terrible thing," Sarah said.

"Yeah."

"I told myself it was science. That we were helping people. But that was just a story I needed to believe." She looked at her hands. "I'm going back to basic research. Alzheimer's work. Something that actually helps people without rewriting their brains."

"That sounds good."

"What about you?"

"I don't know. Witness protection. Testimony. After that..." I shrugged. "Maybe I'll finally use that English degree. Write a book or something."

Sarah almost smiled. "About this?"

"God, no. Fiction. Something where I make up the story on purpose, and everyone knows it's not real."

"That sounds healthier."

We sat in silence for a moment.

"I'm sorry," I said. "For dragging you into this. For not stopping it sooner."

"I dragged myself in. And I didn't stop it either." Sarah met my eyes. "But we stopped it eventually. That has to count for something."

"Does it?"

"I'm choosing to believe it does. Otherwise..." She trailed off. "Otherwise I can't live with what we did."

The agent at the door cleared his throat. "Time's up."

Sarah stood. Held out her hand. I shook it.

"Good luck, Riley."

"You too, Dr. Chen."

She left. I didn't see her again.

### Chapter 12: Memory

The trial lasted six weeks. I testified for four days. Explained the technology, the procedures, the clients. Watched Victor's defense attorney try to tear apart my credibility. Watched the jury's faces as they learned what memory theft looked like.

Victor was convicted on seventy-three counts. Sentenced to forty years.

His clients—the ones who bought stolen memories—faced their own trials. Some were convicted. Some took plea deals. All of them had their purchased memories seized as evidence.

The technology was declared illegal. Federal ban on neural interface devices for memory extraction or implantation. The lab was dismantled. The equipment destroyed.

Project Revise ended. Officially.

I spent a year in witness protection. Small town in Oregon, working at a coffee shop, living under a name that wasn't mine. The marshals said it was temporary. Just until the trials concluded and the threat level decreased.

On my twenty-eighth birthday, they said I could go home.

"Home" was complicated. I couldn't go back to New York—too many people remembered Riley Walsh the memory thief. Couldn't go back to Pennsylvania—the news coverage had reached there too.

So I went to Seattle. New city, new name, new life. Got a job at a bookstore. Rented a studio apartment with a view of the water. Started therapy with a woman named Dr. Martinez who specialized in moral injury.

"You participated in something harmful," Dr. Martinez said during our third session. "And now you're trying to reconcile that with your sense of self. That's normal. Difficult, but normal."

"How do people usually reconcile it?"

"Different ways. Some through service—trying to balance the harm with good deeds. Some through advocacy—working to prevent similar harm. Some through acceptance—learning to live with moral complexity." She looked at me. "What feels right to you?"

I thought about it. "Writing," I said. "Telling the story. Not for publication—just for me. So I remember it accurately. So I can't rewrite my own history and pretend I was less complicit than I was."

"That sounds like a healthy approach."

So I wrote. Filled notebooks with everything that happened. The extractions, the implantations, the trial. Diane Fletcher and her burnt coffee love. Maya and her bicycle. Aaron and his imaginary friend. Marcus and his stolen five years.

I wrote it down exactly as I remembered it. No revisions. No making myself look better. Just the truth, messy and complicated and mine.

One day, two years after the trial, I got a letter. No return address, but I recognized the handwriting.

Sarah.

The letter was short:

*Riley,*

*I don't know if you want to hear from me. I understand if you don't. But I thought you should know: I'm working on Alzheimer's research at a university in Boston. Real research, ethical research, IRB-approved and FDA-monitored. We're making progress on memory preservation without alteration.*

*I think about our work sometimes. The people we helped—Maya, Aaron, the others who wanted better memories than reality gave them. I still believe we helped some of them. But I also know we harmed them. Gave them foundations built on lies.*

*I don't know if that balance ever tips toward redemption. But I'm trying to do better. I hope you are too.*

*- S*

I wrote back:

*Sarah,*

*I'm glad you're doing real work now. The kind that helps without harm. That matters.*

*I think about them too. All of them. The ones whose memories we stole and the ones whose memories we built. I hope they're okay. I hope the ones who chose to keep their implants find peace with them. I hope the ones who chose extraction find peace without them.*

*As for redemption—I don't know either. But I'm trying. Writing, therapy, living honestly. Maybe that's enough. Maybe it isn't. I'm learning to live with not knowing.*

*Good luck with the research. Really. The world needs more people trying to solve problems without creating new ones.*

I didn't hear from her again. That was okay. Some connections are meant to be temporary. Brief collaborations in moral gray areas, then separation to heal.

I kept writing. Kept working at the bookstore. Kept seeing Dr. Martinez. Slowly, carefully, built a life that felt like mine. Made from real experiences, real choices, real consequences.

Sometimes I wondered about the forty-seven people whose memories I'd stolen. If they ever found out. If they forgave the violation. If forgiveness was even possible for something they didn't know had happened.

Sometimes I wondered about the subjects—the sixty-three people who'd received implanted memories. How many kept them. How many erased them. How many lived with the knowledge that part of their past was fiction.

Mostly I wondered about myself. Who I would have been without those eight months. If I'd have more student debt and less moral complexity. If that would have been better.

No way to know. Memory is linear. Life only moves forward.

So I moved forward. One day at a time. One real memory after another.

And sometimes—not often, but sometimes—I'd touch the scar on my knee from crashing into Mrs. Patterson's rosebushes, and I'd remember being seven years old, learning to ride a bike, my father laughing in the background.

Real memory. My memory. No one could take it. No one could change it.

It was mine.

And in the end, maybe that was enough.

## Epilogue: Ten Years Later

The email came on a Tuesday. Subject line: "Memory Theft Victim Support Group."

I stared at it for a long time before opening.

*Dear Riley Walsh,*

*My name is Jennifer Chen. You don't know me, but you saved my boyfriend's life ten years ago. Marcus—Subject Fifty-Seven in your records—told me what really happened. How his memory was destroyed and repaired. How you chose to confess instead of run.*

*Marcus and I got married seven years ago. We have two children now. He still has occasional gaps in his memory from that time, but he's here. He's whole. Because you stopped Victor before he could do worse.*

*I'm writing because I started a support group for people affected by memory theft and implantation. Victims, subjects, even former employees trying to rebuild their lives. We meet monthly in New York. Virtual attendance is available.*

*I thought you might want to know. In case you ever need to connect with people who understand.*

*No pressure. Just an invitation.*

*- Jennifer*

I sat in my Seattle apartment, looking out at the water, holding an invitation to face the past I'd spent ten years trying to integrate.

Dr. Martinez would say it was my choice. No right answer. Just what felt true for me.

I thought about Diane Fletcher. About Maya and Aaron and all the others. About Sarah working on Alzheimer's research. About Marcus living a real life with real memories, mostly.

I thought about the story I'd written in my notebooks. The truth I'd preserved so I couldn't forget who I'd been.

And I thought about who I was now. Riley Walsh, thirty-eight years old. Bookstore employee. Coffee enthusiast. Person trying to live honestly with complicated history.

I opened a reply window and started typing:

*Dear Jennifer,*

*Thank you for reaching out. I'd like to attend...*

Outside, the Seattle sky was grey and heavy with rain. Real rain, falling on a real city, where real people lived real lives with all their messy, imperfect, beautiful memories intact.

I hit send.

The light from my computer screen reflected in the window. A small beacon in the growing dark.

I watched it for a while. Then I closed my laptop, put on my jacket, and went out into the real world.

One step at a time. One true memory after another.

Moving forward. Always forward.

The past couldn't be rewritten. But the future was still blank pages, waiting to be filled with choices I could live with.

I intended to fill them well.
