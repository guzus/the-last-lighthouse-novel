# The Last Dragon

---

The dragon came to our village on the first morning of spring.

We saw the smoke before we saw her—a dark ribbon rising from the valley below, winding between the mountains like a river flowing upward. Then came the sound: not the roar we'd heard in stories, but something softer. A keening. Almost like singing.

"She's dying," my grandmother said from the doorway of our cottage. She didn't sound afraid. Just sad. "The last of them, finally coming home."

I was sixteen years old, and I'd never seen a dragon. No one my age had. They'd been gone for generations, retreating to the deep places as humanity spread across the land. Hunted, some said. Extinct, others believed.

But here she was, descending through the spring mist toward our valley with wings that blotted out the sun.

## Part I: The Arrival

The village council convened immediately. Thirty people crowded into the meeting hall, voices overlapping in panic and confusion.

"We should evacuate!"

"Call the King's Guard!"

"Dragons are monsters—it'll kill us all!"

My grandmother stood and the room fell silent. At seventy-three, she was the oldest person in the village. When she spoke, people listened.

"I've seen a dragon before," she said. "Once, when I was very young. It didn't harm anyone. It landed in the high meadow to rest, and we brought it water and fish from the river. It stayed three days, then left. No one was hurt."

"That was different," Council Head Marten argued. "There were many dragons then. They had territories, rules. This one is alone. Desperate. Dangerous."

"Or frightened," my grandmother said. "And seeking help."

"From humans? After what we did to them?" Marten shook his head. "It's here for revenge. We should defend ourselves."

"With what?" I asked. All eyes turned to me. I shouldn't have spoken—sixteen-year-olds didn't address the council—but the words came anyway. "We're farmers and shepherds. What are we going to do against a dragon? Throw turnips at it?"

A few nervous laughs rippled through the crowd.

"The girl has a point," old Willem said. "If the dragon wanted us dead, we'd be dead already. It's been circling the valley for an hour. A fire-breather could've burned every building by now."

"So what do we do?" someone asked. "Just wait?"

My grandmother looked at me. "Elara, get your walking stick and your courage. We're going to meet her."

"What? No!" My mother grabbed my arm. "Mother, you can't take her to a dragon!"

"Someone has to. The dragon came here for a reason. The least we can do is find out what it is." Grandmother touched my mother's hand gently. "Elara has the gift. Same as I did. Same as you would have, if you'd chosen to develop it."

"What gift?" I asked.

"The hearing. You can understand animals when they speak, can't you? The horses, the dogs, even the songbirds. You've always known what they needed."

I'd never told anyone about that. How I could sense the emotions of creatures around me. Feel their fear, their joy, their pain. I'd thought I was imagining it.

"Dragons are not animals," Marten warned. "They're intelligent. Possibly more intelligent than us. That gift of yours might not work the same way."

"Then I'll learn," I said, surprising myself. "If the dragon came here to communicate, someone should try to listen."

My mother looked between grandmother and me, fear and pride warring on her face. Finally, she sighed. "Take the silver cloak. And the good rope. And—and be careful. Please."

Grandmother and I set out into the valley.

## Part II: The Meeting

We found the dragon in the old stone circle, the ruins where people said the first settlers had worshipped the old gods. She was massive—easily the size of our barn, with scales that shimmered between green and gold in the morning light. Her wings were folded against her sides, and there was a stillness to her that felt wrong. Like a great tree that had stopped growing.

As we approached, I felt it: a wave of emotion so powerful it nearly knocked me down. Pain. Exhaustion. And underneath it all, a deep, aching loneliness.

"She's hurt," I whispered.

Grandmother nodded. "Can you tell her we mean no harm?"

I didn't know how. With horses, I just had to be near them, thinking calm thoughts. But this was a dragon. A creature of legend and fire and ancient magic.

I closed my eyes and tried anyway.

*We are here to help. Please don't be afraid.*

The dragon's massive head turned toward us. Her eyes were golden, with slit pupils like a cat's. They were also intelligent. Frighteningly so.

And then I heard her voice. Not in my ears, but in my mind. Deep and resonant and unutterably tired.

**You hear me, little one?**

*Yes.*

**Good. I had hoped... but I wasn't certain. The gift is rare in your kind.**

*Are you hurt?*

**Dying. Not from injury. From time. I am the last, and I have lived too long.**

The dragon shifted, and I saw what I'd missed before. Her scales were dull in places, flaking. One wing had a tear that had healed badly. She looked ancient. Weary.

"What does she say?" grandmother asked.

"She's dying," I said aloud. "Old age. She says she's the last."

Grandmother's eyes filled with tears. "Ask her why she came here."

I didn't need to ask. The dragon was already answering.

**I came because dragons do not die alone in the dark places. We return to where we began. And this valley... this was the first place of my kind. Where the first dragon egg was laid, three thousand years ago. I came home to remember. To honor those who came before. To close the circle.**

I translated, my own voice breaking. There was something unbearably sad about it—this ancient being, flying across the world to die in a place that probably didn't even remember it had been important.

"Tell her she's welcome here," grandmother said. "Tell her we'll keep her company, if she wants it. She shouldn't be alone."

I passed the message along.

The dragon made a sound—a soft rumble that might have been a laugh.

**Your kind feared us. Hunted us. Drove us from these lands. Why would you offer comfort now?**

*Because you're alone. And no one should die alone.*

The dragon was quiet for a long moment. Then:

**What is your name, little one?**

*Elara.*

**I am Aurimara. Last of the Sky Flames. First of nothing.** Another pause. **Your kindness is... unexpected. I will accept your company, if you truly offer it.**

"She says yes," I told grandmother.

And so we sat with a dying dragon, while the morning turned to afternoon, and the village below watched with fearful, curious eyes.

---

## Part III: The Stories

Over the next three days, half the village came to see Aurimara. At first they came out of fear—better to know where the dragon was than to wonder. But slowly, as word spread that she was harmless, dying, alone, the fear transformed into something else.

Curiosity. Compassion. Even grief for something we'd never known we'd lost.

People brought offerings. Not treasure—we were poor farmers—but food and water. Blankets that Aurimara didn't need but accepted anyway. Children brought flowers and asked shy questions that I translated.

"How high can you fly?"

**As high as the clouds. Higher, once, before my wings grew tired.**

"Did you really breathe fire?"

**Yes. Would you like to see?**

She exhaled a tiny flame—barely enough to light a candle—and the children gasped in delight.

But mostly, Aurimara told stories.

She spoke of the ancient days, when dragons filled the skies and humans were still learning to farm. How they'd coexisted at first—dragons hunting in the wild places, humans building in the gentle valleys. How they'd even helped each other sometimes, dragons fighting off the great predators that threatened human settlements, humans sharing food in hard winters.

"What happened?" I asked. "Why did we become enemies?"

**Fear,** Aurimara said. **Dragons lived long. Grew powerful. Your kind saw power and feared it would be used against you. So you struck first. Hunted us. Killed the eggs so new dragons wouldn't be born. We fought back, and the fear became justified. A cycle of violence that neither side could break.**

"I'm sorry," I said. "For what my people did."

**I'm sorry too. For the villages my kind burned. For the wars we could have prevented but didn't. We were both young species then. We both made mistakes.**

On the second day, scholars came from the capital—men in robes who wanted to document everything, to study the last dragon before she died. Aurimara tolerated them with patient amusement.

One scholar, a man named Petras, asked: "What is the secret of dragon fire? How do you create flame from nothing?"

**It's not from nothing. It's from within. From the part of us that burns brightest—our passion, our rage, our joy. We breathe out what we feel most strongly. That's why young dragons have the hottest flames. They feel everything intensely.**

"And old dragons?"

Aurimara's flame flickered weakly. **Old dragons have burned through their passion. We have little fire left. Only embers.**

On the third day, she told me the thing she'd come to say.

We were alone—grandmother had gone back to the village for supplies, and the curious crowds had thinned. It was evening, and the stars were coming out.

**Elara,** Aurimara said. **I need to ask something of you.**

*Anything.*

**When I die—soon, I think—my body will remain. It will not decay like mortal flesh. Dragon bones last millennia. Dragon scales never tarnish.** She turned her great head to look at me. **Your kind will want to take them. To sell, to study, to display in museums. I cannot stop this. But I have a request.**

*Tell me.*

**My heart. When a dragon dies, the heart crystallizes. Becomes a stone of great power. It holds the essence of what we were—our memories, our magic, our fire.** Her golden eyes held mine. **I want you to take my heart. Keep it safe. And when the time is right—if the time is ever right—use it to bring dragons back.**

I stared at her. "Bring you back? How?"

**The heart contains everything needed to create a dragon egg. Given the right magic, the right circumstances, new life could come from old. But it would take centuries. Millennia, perhaps. And I don't know if your world will ever be ready for dragons again.**

**But if it is... if someday humans have grown wise enough to coexist with creatures as powerful as you are... then the possibility should exist. The choice should be available.**

*Why me?*

**Because you listened. Because you sat with a dying creature and offered comfort instead of fear. Because the gift you have—the hearing—is rare, and precious, and exactly what would be needed to raise a dragon. They are not pets. They are partners. And partnership requires understanding.**

I thought about the responsibility she was asking for. Not just for me, but for my children, their children, generations down through time. Guardians of a dead species' last hope.

"What if we fail?" I asked aloud. "What if the heart is lost, or stolen, or broken?"

**Then dragons die forever, and the world moves on without us. It would not be the first species to vanish. It would not be the last.** She lowered her head until it was level with mine. **But Elara, I have lived three thousand years. I have seen empires rise and fall. I have seen humans at their worst and their best. And I believe—I choose to believe—that someday, your kind will be ready. That someday, the world will have room for dragons again.**

**I am asking you to keep that possibility alive.**

I put my hand on her scaled snout. It was warm, like sun-baked stone.

"I'll do it," I said. "I promise."

**Thank you.**

She closed her eyes. **I'm tired now. I think... I think I'll rest.**

"Should I get my grandmother? The others?"

**No. Stay. Just... stay. Please.**

So I stayed.

I sat beside the last dragon as the stars wheeled overhead. As her breathing slowed. As her great body grew still.

Aurimara died as dawn broke over the mountains, with her head resting on the ancient stones where the first dragon had been born, three thousand years before.

And I sat with her, holding a promise I didn't know how to keep.

---

## Part IV: The Guardian

The scholars came with tools and wagons. They catalogued every scale, every bone, every tooth. The King himself sent representatives, claiming the body as national heritage. There were arguments, negotiations, paperwork.

Through it all, I waited.

On the third day after Aurimara's death, I asked Petras the scholar if I could see her one last time before they transported the remains.

He agreed, though he looked puzzled. "There's not much to see anymore, child. We've removed almost everything for preservation."

"I know. I just want to say goodbye."

He left me alone with what remained of Aurimara. The massive skeleton, stripped of scales and flesh. And there, in the chest cavity, something that glowed with a soft golden light.

Her heart.

It had crystallized exactly as she said—a stone the size of my head, multifaceted like a gem, pulsing with internal fire. Beautiful and terrifying.

I took it.

I wrapped it in my cloak, my hands shaking, and I walked out of that tent knowing I was stealing something priceless. Something that museums would pay fortunes for. Something that could change the world.

I took it home and hid it under the floorboards of my room.

No one noticed it was missing. In their inventory of dragon parts, the scholars assumed someone else had catalogued the heart. By the time they realized it was gone, I was just a village girl who'd sat with the dragon. Why would I have taken anything?

I became the first guardian.

I married at twenty-three. Had three children. Taught my daughter Sera the family secret when she was sixteen—the same age I'd been when I met Aurimara. She had the gift too, the hearing. She could speak to the animals, sense their emotions.

"This is your inheritance," I told her, showing her the crystallized heart glowing in its hiding place. "Not gold or land. A promise. A possibility. Someday, if the world is ready, we bring them back."

"How will we know?" she asked. "How will we know when it's time?"

"I don't know. But we'll keep watch. We'll keep faith. And we'll teach our children to do the same."

The years passed. I grew old. Sera became the guardian after me. She taught her own daughter. The promise passed down through generations like a whispered story.

The world changed around us. Kingdoms rose and fell. Technology advanced. Magic faded from common use, became the stuff of legends.

And in a hidden place, wrapped in cloth and kept in darkness, a dragon's heart waited.

## Epilogue: One Thousand Years Later

Her name was Elara—named for the first guardian, as all the eldest daughters in our family were. She was sixteen years old, and she'd just been shown the family secret.

"It's a dragon's heart," her mother explained. "The last dragon, who died a thousand years ago. Our family has protected it ever since."

Elara stared at the crystallized heart, still glowing with impossible inner fire after ten centuries. "Why? Why keep it?"

"Because she asked us to. Because she believed that someday, the world might be ready for dragons again."

"But we don't even have magic anymore. How would we...?"

"I don't know." Her mother touched the heart gently. "But I know the world is changing. People are remembering the old ways. Trying to heal the damage we've done to the land. Maybe... maybe that's the beginning of being ready."

Elara felt something then. A sensation she'd had all her life but never understood. A sense of connection to the living things around her. The trees in the garden. The birds in the eaves. The deep, sleeping awareness of the earth itself.

The gift. The hearing.

She touched the heart, and for a moment—just a moment—she heard a voice. Deep and ancient and filled with hope.

**Soon,** it said. **Perhaps not today. Perhaps not in your lifetime. But soon. Keep faith, little guardian. Keep watch. The world turns, and all things that were lost can be found again.**

Elara looked at her mother. "I hear her. The dragon. She's still there. In the heart."

Her mother smiled through tears. "Then the wait continues. Until the world is ready. Until the time is right."

"And if that time comes in my lifetime? What do I do?"

"You'll know. The same way the first Elara knew when to listen. You'll feel it." Her mother closed the box containing the heart. "Until then, we guard. We preserve. We keep the possibility alive."

"That's a long burden to carry."

"Yes. But it's also a gift. We get to be the keepers of hope. The guardians of second chances. Not many people can say that."

Elara thought about that. About a thousand years of women in her family, protecting a promise made to a dying dragon. About all the things that had been lost in that time—magic, wonder, the belief that impossible things could happen.

And about the stubborn faith required to believe they could come back.

"I'll do it," she said. "I'll be the guardian."

"I know you will." Her mother hugged her. "You were named for it. Chosen for it. And when the time comes—if it comes—you'll know what to do."

Outside, the world continued turning. Cities grew. Technology advanced. The old stories faded into myth.

But in a small house, in a hidden chamber, a dragon's heart burned on.

Waiting.

Hoping.

Dreaming of a day when the skies would fill with wings again.

And in the heart of the last dragon, a consciousness slept and waited and believed.

*Soon.*

**THE END**

*"Hope is the thing with feathers. But faith is the thing with scales, breathing embers in the dark, waiting to become fire again."*
