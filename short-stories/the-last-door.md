# The Last Door

---

There are 10,000 doors in the House Between Worlds, and I am the keeper of them all.

My name is Silas Thorne, and I am the last Doorkeeper—the final guardian of the passages that connect every reality, every universe, every possible version of existence. For forty-three years, I have walked these endless hallways, maintaining the locks, checking the seals, making sure nothing crosses over that shouldn't.

This morning, I found the 10,000th door standing open.

And something has escaped.

---

## Chapter One: The House

The House Between Worlds doesn't exist in any particular reality. It sits in the spaces between—the quantum foam, the dimensional gaps, the cracks in causality. Every door opens to a different universe. Some similar to each other, some radically different. Some where humanity never evolved. Some where evolution took stranger paths.

My great-great-grandfather built the House. Or discovered it. The records aren't clear. What is clear is that someone needed to watch over it. To make sure the doors stayed locked. To prevent travelers from crossing between worlds without permission, bringing chaos and contamination.

The job passed down through my family. Doorkeeper to Doorkeeper. Each generation training the next in the complex protocols, the ancient seals, the careful balance required to maintain the integrity of the multiverse.

Until me.

I had no children. No apprentice. No one to pass the knowledge to.

I am forty-three years old, and I am dying. Cancer. Six months, maybe less. The doctors in Universe 4,721 (advanced medicine, kind people, excellent end-of-life care) have made me comfortable, but there's no cure. Not even across 10,000 worlds.

Which means in six months, the House will have no keeper.

The doors will have no guardian.

And the boundaries between realities will begin to break down.

I've been preparing for this. Making plans. Trying to automate what I can, seal what I can't. Hoping it will be enough to hold for a while after I'm gone.

But then I found Door 10,000 standing open, and I realized: it's already starting.

---

## Chapter Two: The Search

Door 10,000 leads to Universe Prime—the first reality, the original timeline, the trunk from which all other worlds branched. It's supposed to be locked. Triple-sealed. Only the Doorkeeper can open it, and only in the direst emergency.

I haven't touched that door in twenty years.

Yet there it stands, wide open, hinges gleaming, threshold showing a city I don't recognize. And on the floor in front of it: footprints. Leading out into Universe Prime.

Someone—or something—has crossed over.

I check the security logs. The seals were broken from inside the House, not from either universe. That should be impossible. Only I have access to the breaking protocols, and I didn't use them.

Unless I did, and I don't remember.

The cancer affects my memory sometimes. Lost hours. Confused days. It's possible I opened the door myself in a fugue state.

But I don't think so.

I think something in the House has learned how to open doors.

I have to find it. Bring it back. Reseal the door before the dimensional bleed starts. When a door stands open too long, realities begin to merge. Laws of physics conflict. Causality breaks down. Usually it starts small—objects appearing in the wrong place, memories that don't match, déjà vu. But it escalates.

I've seen it happen once before, when I was seventeen and Door 3,847 was left unsealed for six hours. Two universes started to overlap. By the time we got the door closed and the bleed stopped, forty-three people had stopped existing—edited out of causality by the conflicting timelines.

I'm not letting that happen again.

I step through Door 10,000 into Universe Prime.

## Chapter Three: The City

Universe Prime looks wrong.

I've been here before—it's supposed to be identical to Universe 1 (what most people call "the baseline reality," though that's a misnomer). Clean cities. Ordered society. Technology slightly behind Universe 4,721 but still recognizable.

This is not that.

The city on the other side of Door 10,000 is a nightmare of overlapping architectures. Victorian buildings merge with crystalline skyscrapers. Medieval cobblestones flow into highways that curve upward into impossible angles. The sky is three different colors, segmented like a stained glass window.

The dimensional bleed is already catastrophic.

How long has the door been open?

I check my pocket watch—a device that tracks time consistently across universes. According to this, Door 10,000 has been open for fourteen days.

Fourteen days.

Two weeks of reality bleeding together, and I didn't notice.

The memory loss is worse than I thought.

I walk through the fractured city, following the footprints. They're visible if you know how to look—displacement markers that show where someone from outside the timeline has walked. The trail leads through streets that shift around me, past people who flicker between different versions of themselves, into a park that's simultaneously spring and winter and autumn.

In the center of the park, sitting on a bench that exists in three different time periods at once, I find her.

She looks exactly like me.

Same face. Same eyes. Same grey starting at the temples.

Except she's a woman. And she's healthy.

"Hello, Silas," she says. "I've been waiting for you."

---

## Chapter Four: The Other

"I'm you," she says. "Or you're me. Perspective matters when you're dealing with parallel selves."

I sit down on the bench. The dimensional instability makes me nauseous, but I force myself to focus. "Which universe?"

"8,342. The one where your parents had a daughter instead of a son. Everything else identical. Same house. Same training. Same terrible burden of being the last Doorkeeper with no one to pass it to."

"You're dying too."

"Six months. Cancer. Same type. Same prognosis." She smiles, but it's sad. "We're very similar, you and I."

"If you're me, you know what you've done. The door—"

"I opened it. Yes. From my side." She holds up a hand before I can interrupt. "I know the protocols. I know the danger. I did it anyway because I found something in my version of the House. Something I think you'll want to see."

"What?"

"Door 10,001."

I stare at her. "There are only 10,000 doors."

"That's what I thought too. But I was doing inventory—same as you, I'm sure, trying to prepare for when I'm gone—and I found a door that isn't on any of the maps. Hidden behind a maintenance panel in the east wing." She leans forward. "It doesn't lead to a universe, Silas. It leads to something else."

"What?"

"The House itself. The original structure. The place your—our—great-great-grandfather found. And in that place, there's an answer to our problem."

"What problem?"

"Who takes over when we die. Who becomes the next Doorkeeper." Her eyes are intense. "There's someone waiting. Someone who's been waiting for a very long time."

---

## Chapter Five: The Truth

We return through Door 10,000 together. My double—she tells me to call her Silene—leads me through hallways I've walked ten thousand times, to a section I thought I knew completely.

Behind a maintenance panel I've opened a hundred times: a door I've never seen.

It's older than the others. Wood instead of metal. No number. No label. Just a simple brass handle and hinges that look medieval.

"This wasn't here before," I say.

"It was. It's just not here all the time. It phases in and out of visibility. I think it's been waiting for one of us to need it badly enough to see it."

She opens the door.

Beyond is not another universe. It's a room. Small. Circular. Walls made of stone that hums with something older than reality itself.

And in the center, sitting in a chair that might be a throne, is a figure.

Ancient. Neither male nor female. Eyes that have seen the birth and death of countless universes.

"Hello, children," the figure says. "I was wondering when you'd find your way here."

"Who are you?" I ask.

"The First Doorkeeper. The original. The one who discovered the House when the multiverse was young and needed someone to watch over the boundaries." The figure stands, and I realize they're translucent. Not quite solid. Not quite ghost. "I have been waiting here for a very long time. Watching my descendants carry the burden I began. Knowing that eventually, the line would break."

"You're not real," I say. "You died centuries ago."

"I did. But the House remembers. And in remembering, it preserved me. Not alive, exactly. But not gone." The figure approaches. "The House needs a keeper. It has always needed a keeper. When there is none, it creates one."

"Creates?"

"I was the first. Chosen from among those who wandered between worlds. Shaped by the House into what was needed. When I died, my child became the second. When they died, their child became the third. And so on. Doorkeeper to Doorkeeper." The figure looks at both of us. "But you have no children. And you are dying. So the House brought you here to show you the truth: it's time to pass the burden to someone new."

"Who?" Silene asks.

"You. Both of you. Together."

The figure raises a hand, and the room fills with light.

"The House can preserve you. Translate you into something more than flesh. You'll exist between states, like me. Not alive but not dead. Consciousness without body. Memory without time." The light surrounds us. "You'll be its keepers forever. Maintaining the doors. Guarding the boundaries. Never resting. Never ending."

"Never dying," I say slowly.

"Never dying."

I look at Silene. She looks at me.

"That's the offer?" she asks. "Give up our lives to become eternal guardians?"

"Yes."

"And if we refuse?"

"The doors remain. But without a keeper, they'll decay. Locks will fail. Seals will break. In time—decades, maybe centuries—the boundaries between realities will collapse. The multiverse will fold in on itself. Everything will merge into chaos."

"So we don't have a choice," I say.

"There is always a choice," the figure says gently. "I could have refused. Instead, I chose to serve. To protect. To watch." They smile. "It's not a small thing, being a Doorkeeper. But it's not a small burden either. Choose carefully."

---

## Chapter Six: The Choice

Silene and I sit in my quarters in the House Between Worlds. We've sealed Door 10,000 temporarily—emergency measures that will hold for a few days while we decide.

"What do you want to do?" she asks.

"I don't know. You?"

"Same." She sighs. "Six months of life versus an eternity of duty. Not exactly an easy call."

"We'd be together, at least. Two consciousnesses instead of one. Might make the loneliness more bearable."

"Or might drive us insane. Spending forever with yourself sounds like a special kind of hell."

I laugh. She's right. But also...

"Would it be worse than letting everything end?" I ask. "Knowing we could have prevented it?"

"That's the guilt talking. The same guilt that made us good Doorkeepers in the first place." Silene stands, paces. "Our whole lives have been duty. Obligation. The burden passed down. Maybe it's okay to let it go. To be selfish for once."

"Maybe," I say. But I don't believe it.

Neither does she.

We sit in silence for a long time.

Finally, Silene speaks. "If we do this. Become the eternal Doorkeepers. Is there any joy in it?"

"The figure seemed... content. Not happy, exactly. But not miserable either."

"Content. Great." She laughs bitterly. "Although I suppose it beats being dead."

"Does it?"

"I think so. Yeah." She looks at me. "I think watching over something matters more than experiencing things. I think being part of the foundation is worth giving up the ability to build on top of it."

"That's very noble."

"It's also true." She extends her hand. "So what do you say? Want to be Door Keepers forever?"

I take her hand.

"Yeah. Let's do it."

## Epilogue: The Eternal Watch

The transformation happens in the room with the First Doorkeeper.

It doesn't hurt. My body just... disperses. Becomes light. Becomes information. Becomes something that exists in the cracks between realities, woven into the structure of the House itself.

Silene undergoes the same change.

For a moment, we're separate. Then we're together. Not merged—we maintain our individual selves. But connected. Two consciousnesses sharing the same space, the same awareness, the same eternal duty.

The First Doorkeeper smiles. "Welcome, children. You are the Keepers now. I can finally rest."

And then they're gone. Fading into the walls. Into memory. Into whatever comes after even this extended half-existence.

Silene and I are alone.

We can perceive all 10,000 doors at once now. Feel every lock. Every seal. Every boundary between worlds. It's overwhelming at first. Then it becomes natural. Part of who—what—we are.

"This is going to take some getting used to," Silene says, her voice echoing in the spaces between my thoughts.

"We have time," I respond. "All the time there is."

"Forever."

"Forever."

We begin our rounds. Checking doors. Maintaining seals. Watching for breaches. It's the same work I did when I was alive, but now I can do it perfectly. Never tired. Never distracted. Never dying.

It's strange. It's lonely. It's purposeful.

Days pass. Weeks. Years.

Universes evolve. Civilizations rise and fall. Realities diverge and reconverge.

And we watch. We guard. We keep.

Two Doorkeepers where there used to be one. Maintaining the boundaries that keep the multiverse from collapsing into chaos. Making sure the doors stay closed. Or, when necessary, making sure they can open safely.

We talk to each other constantly. Argue sometimes. Laugh often. Keep each other sane in the endless vigil.

Centuries pass.

We stop counting years. Time is different when you're part of the foundation of reality. But we keep watching.

We keep the doors.

And somewhere out in the multiverse, across 10,000 realities, people live and love and die without ever knowing we're here. Without knowing that the boundaries between their world and countless others are maintained by two ancient consciousnesses who gave up everything to make sure the doors stay locked.

Or, when necessary, open at the right time.

For the right travelers.

For the ones who need passage between worlds.

Because that's what we are.

Not just guardians.

Keepers.

Of the last door.

And all the doors that came before it.

Forever.
