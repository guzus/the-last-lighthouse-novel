# The Last Lighthouse

---

The storm came at twilight, as storms always did on the edge of the world.

Mara watched it roll in from her post at the top of the lighthouse, a wall of grey consuming the horizon. She'd seen a thousand storms from this perch—maybe more. After thirty-seven years, she'd stopped counting. They all blurred together into one endless cycle of wind and rain and the relentless pounding of waves against rock.

She checked the lamp mechanism one more time. Oil reservoir full. Wick trimmed. Lens polished to perfect clarity. Everything exactly as it should be. The light would burn through the night, as it had burned for two hundred years, warning ships away from the rocks that had claimed so many before the lighthouse was built.

Not that there were many ships anymore.

The radio crackled to life. "Keeper Mara, this is mainland control. Storm warning upgraded to severe. Recommend you secure for Category 4 conditions."

Mara picked up the handset. "Copy that, control. Lighthouse is secure. Light will remain operational."

"Understood. Stay safe out there."

"Always do."

She set down the radio and descended the spiral stairs, her footsteps echoing in the stone tower. The lighthouse had stood for two centuries, surviving storms that would have leveled modern buildings. It would survive this one too. It always did.

In the keeper's quarters at the base of the tower, Mara made tea and settled into her worn armchair by the window. Outside, the sea was already churning, white foam visible even in the failing light. The first drops of rain hit the glass.

She opened her journal—the leather-bound book where she recorded each day's observations. Wind direction, wave height, visibility, ships sighted. Tonight she wrote:

*October 17th. Storm approaching from northwest. No vessels in sight. Light operational. All systems normal.*

Below that, she paused, pen hovering over paper. Then added:

*Still alone.*

She'd written those words many times over the years. Sometimes they felt like a lament. Sometimes like a simple statement of fact. Tonight, with the storm building and darkness falling, they felt like both.

Mara had taken the keeper's position when she was twenty-three, fresh from a maritime academy and eager to prove herself. The posting was considered punishment duty—isolated, difficult, with none of the prestige of the automated lighthouse systems that were replacing human keepers across the coast. But Mara had wanted it. Had requested it specifically.

She'd needed distance from the world. From people. From a life that had felt too small and too loud and too full of expectations she couldn't meet.

The lighthouse had given her that distance. Miles of empty ocean. Weeks between supply runs. Nothing but the rhythm of the tides and the turning of the light and the endless watch.

At first, she'd thought she'd stay a year. Maybe two. Just long enough to figure out what came next.

But year followed year, and what came next never materialized. The world moved on without her. Lighthouse keepers became obsolete. The automation systems improved. Funding dried up. One by one, the manned stations went dark or converted to remote operation.

Until only one remained.

The last lighthouse. The last keeper.

Mara had received the notice three months ago. Formal letterhead, bureaucratic language, but the message was clear: effective January 1st, the lighthouse would be automated. Her position was being eliminated. Her services were no longer required.

She had seventy-five days left.

The storm hit in full force around midnight. Wind howled around the tower, and rain lashed the windows with a sound like thrown gravel. Mara made her rounds every hour, checking the light, monitoring the equipment, watching the darkness beyond the beam.

No ships. There were never ships anymore.

The shipping lanes had shifted decades ago. Modern navigation systems made lighthouses redundant. Even the fishing boats avoided these waters—overfished, too dangerous, easier catches elsewhere.

The light burned for ghosts now. For tradition. For the principle that someone should keep watch over the dangerous places, even if no one sailed them anymore.

At 3 AM, during one of her rounds, Mara saw it.

A light in the darkness. Not the reflected beam of her own lighthouse, but something else. Something moving.

She grabbed her binoculars and scanned the storm-tossed waters.

There. A boat. Small, wooden, riding the massive swells with a grace that seemed impossible. And in the boat, a figure at the oars.

Mara's heart hammered. No one could survive out there. Not in this storm. Not in a boat like that.

She grabbed the radio. "Mainland control, this is Lighthouse Keeper Mara. I have a vessel in distress. Small boat, single occupant, two hundred yards off the reef. Request immediate Coast Guard response."

Static.

"Mainland control, do you copy?"

More static. The storm must be interfering with the signal.

Mara didn't hesitate. She pulled on her rain gear and ran down the stairs, through the keeper's quarters, out into the screaming wind.

The path to the beach was treacherous in good weather. In a storm like this, it was nearly suicidal. But Mara had walked it thousands of times. She knew every rock, every handhold, every place where the path crumbled into nothing.

She made it to the small dock where she kept her emergency boat—a rigid inflatable designed for exactly this kind of rescue. It took precious minutes to launch it in the heavy surf, but finally she was in the water, engine roaring, fighting her way toward where she'd seen the light.

The waves were monstrous. Twenty feet, maybe more. The little boat climbed each one like a mountain, then crashed down the other side. Salt spray blinded her. The rain was a solid curtain.

"Where are you?" she shouted into the wind. "Where—"

There. The wooden boat, somehow still afloat, still moving toward the rocks.

Mara gunned the engine, closing the distance. "I'm Coast Guard adjacent! I'm here to help!"

The figure in the boat looked up. In a flash of lightning, Mara saw her face.

A young woman, maybe twenty-five, with dark hair plastered to her skull and eyes that seemed to glow with their own light. She was rowing steadily, unhurried, as if the storm was merely inconvenient weather rather than a killing force.

"You need to abandon your vessel!" Mara shouted. "Come aboard!"

The woman smiled. "I'm almost there."

"There's nothing there but rocks! You'll be killed!"

"I'm going to the lighthouse."

Another wave lifted them both, and for a moment they were suspended on the crest, looking at each other across fifteen feet of churning water.

"Why?" Mara asked, though she knew the woman probably couldn't hear her.

The woman's smile widened. "Because someone has to tell the keeper her watch is almost done."

Then the wave crashed down, and when Mara surfaced, sputtering and fighting to keep her boat under control, the wooden boat was gone.

Mara searched for twenty minutes. Scanned every yard of water between her position and the shore. Found nothing.

Finally, low on fuel and half-swamped, she turned back.

The storm broke at dawn.

Mara sat in her tower, wrapped in blankets, drinking tea that had gone cold hours ago, staring at the horizon.

She'd searched the rocks at first light. No wreckage. No body. No evidence that the wooden boat or its occupant had ever existed.

Hallucination, probably. Sleep deprivation and stress. Her mind creating drama to break the monotony. Perfectly rational explanation.

Except.

Except when she'd returned to the lighthouse, soaked and exhausted and questioning her sanity, she'd found something on the dock.

A piece of driftwood, worn smooth by salt and time. Carved into its surface was a single word:

*Thank you.*

Mara turned the driftwood over in her hands, feeling the grain, the weight, the undeniable solidity of it.

The radio crackled. "Keeper Mara, this is mainland control. You there? We lost contact during the storm."

She picked up the handset. "I'm here. Lighthouse is operational. No damage."

"Copy that. Glad you're safe. Weather service is calling that the storm of the decade. You did good keeping the light burning."

"Just doing my job."

"Not for much longer, eh? How many days you got left?"

Mara looked at her calendar. Looked at the carved driftwood. Looked out at the sea, calm now, glittering in the morning sun.

"Seventy-four," she said.

"Well, make 'em count. Control out."

The line went dead.

Mara set down the radio and climbed to the top of the tower. The lens gleamed in the daylight, waiting for night. Two hundred years of light. Two hundred years of warning ships away from the rocks. Two hundred years of someone keeping watch.

And now, seventy-four more days.

She thought about the woman in the boat. The impossible survivor of an impossible storm. The carved message: *Thank you.*

Maybe she'd been hallucinating. Maybe the stress had finally gotten to her.

Or maybe—maybe—someone out there still needed the light. Someone Mara would never see on radar or radio. Someone who sailed by different rules.

She'd heard the stories, of course. Every lighthouse keeper did. Tales of ghost ships and phantom sailors. Legends of the drowned returning to thank the keepers who'd tried to save them. Folklore built from isolation and long watches and the human need to find meaning in the endless vigil.

She'd never believed them before.

But she'd never found a carved piece of driftwood before either.

Mara made her decision.

She descended the stairs and pulled out her phone. Dialed the number for the coastal automation office.

"This is Lighthouse Keeper Mara Thompson. I need to speak to someone about my termination date."

"Of course, Ms. Thompson. How can I help?"

"I'd like to request an extension. Through the end of the year. Maybe longer."

"I'm sorry, but the automation installation is scheduled for January. The decision's been made."

"I understand. But I'm formally requesting a review. This lighthouse has had continuous human operation for two centuries. I think it deserves a proper send-off. And I think I deserve a chance to train my replacement."

"There won't be a replacement. The system will be fully automated."

"Then train me on the automation system. Let me be the backup. The emergency operator in case something fails." Mara kept her voice level, professional. "I've been doing this for thirty-seven years. I know this lighthouse better than anyone. That knowledge has value."

A long pause. "Let me transfer you to my supervisor."

Mara spent three hours on the phone. Talking to supervisors, then managers, then someone in the regional office. Making her case. Calling in favors she'd accumulated over decades of perfect service. Arguing that institutional knowledge mattered. That some things shouldn't be automated just because they could be.

Finally, exhausted, she got her answer.

"We can offer you a six-month extension. Part-time. You'd oversee the automation installation and serve as emergency backup. After that, we'll reassess."

"I'll take it."

"You understand the pay is significantly reduced?"

"I understand."

"All right then. We'll send the paperwork. Welcome to the transition team, Ms. Thompson."

Mara hung up and sat in silence for a long time.

Six months. Not forever. Not even close to what she'd hoped for in some secret part of her heart.

But six more months of keeping the light.

Six more months of watching the sea.

Six more months of being here, in case someone needed her.

She picked up the piece of carved driftwood and placed it on the windowsill, where she could see it while she worked.

*Thank you.*

For what? For keeping watch? For being there when no one else would? For believing, even for a moment, that the impossible might be real?

Maybe all of those. Maybe none of them.

Maybe just for staying when the world said to go.

That night, Mara lit the lamp as she always did. Watched the great lens begin its slow rotation, casting its beam across the dark water. Two hundred years of light. Countless ships warned away from the rocks. Countless lives saved by nothing more than someone willing to watch.

And somewhere out there, in the vast darkness of the ocean, maybe someone saw the light and steered safely around the danger.

Or maybe they didn't.

But Mara would keep watching anyway.

Because that's what keepers do.

The light turned. The sea moved. The night deepened.

And in the last lighthouse on the edge of the world, the last keeper kept her vigil, counting down not the days until it ended, but the days she still had left to serve.

Seventy-four days.

Then seventy-three.

Then seventy-two.

Each one a gift. Each one a choice.

To stay. To watch. To keep the light burning.

For the ships that might come.

For the sailors who might need her.

For the impossible survivors of impossible storms.

For herself.

The lighthouse stood. The keeper watched.

And the light burned on.
