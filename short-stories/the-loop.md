# The Loop

---

I've died forty-seven times today.

The first time was a surprise. The second was terrifying. By the tenth, I was starting to understand the pattern. By the twentieth, I was taking notes.

Now, on my forty-eighth iteration through October 17th, 2024, I'm fairly certain I know who's killing me. I just don't know why.

Or how to stop it.

---

## 7:42 AM - Iteration 48

I wake up to my alarm. The red numbers on my clock read 7:42 AM, same as always. Outside my window, Mrs. Patterson is watering her roses in that same floral bathrobe. My phone has three notifications: a spam email about solar panels, a reminder about my dentist appointment (which I'll never make it to), and a text from my sister asking if I'm free for dinner Thursday.

I'm not going to live to see Thursday.

I've died at 9:15 AM (car crash). 10:03 AM (falling air conditioner). 11:47 AM (allergic reaction to lunch). 2:34 PM (mugging gone wrong). 5:12 PM (electrocution). 6:55 PM (gas leak). And at least forty other times, in forty other ways.

Every time, I wake up at 7:42 AM on October 17th.

I've tried everything. Staying in bed—died from a carbon monoxide leak I didn't know existed. Leaving town—car accident on the highway. Calling the police—they thought I was insane; I died in a freak accident while in custody.

Someone is trying to kill me. And they have all the time in the world to get it right.

Because while I'm stuck in this loop, they're not. They're learning. Adapting. Getting more creative with each iteration.

I need to figure out who and why before they find a method I can't come back from.

If there even is a limit to this nightmare.

---

## 8:15 AM - The Investigation Begins

I skip breakfast. I've tried the eggs forty-seven times. Twice they were poisoned.

Instead, I boot up my laptop and pull up the document where I've been keeping notes. Every iteration, every death, every variation I've tried. It reads like a deranged choose-your-own-adventure book written by Death himself.

**Iteration 1:** 9:15 AM - Car runs red light at Main and 5th. T-bones my driver's side. Dead before ambulance arrives.

**Iteration 2:** 10:03 AM - Walking to coffee shop. Air conditioner falls from third-story window. Direct hit. Instant death.

**Iteration 3:** 11:47 AM - Lunch at Ricardo's. Severe allergic reaction despite ordering my usual (no shellfish). Anaphylaxis. Dead in restaurant.

The list goes on. And on.

But there's a pattern. I just haven't seen it yet.

I start mapping the deaths on a timeline, looking for connections. Different locations, different methods, different times of day. The only constant is that I always die on October 17th, and I always wake up at 7:42 AM to try again.

Wait.

I pull up iterations 15, 23, and 31. Different causes of death, but all occurred at the same location: the corner of Main and 5th.

Iteration 15 - hit by car
Iteration 23 - shot in random mugging
Iteration 31 - crushed by falling construction debris

Three "accidents" at the same intersection. That can't be coincidence.

I check my other deaths. Five more occurred within a two-block radius of that intersection. All between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM.

Someone's trying to make sure I don't make it past that intersection this morning.

Which means that's exactly where I need to go.

---

## 9:00 AM - The Intersection

I approach Main and 5th carefully, eyes scanning for threats. The construction site where the debris fell. The bank where the "mugger" shot me. The crosswalk where I've been hit by three different vehicles.

This time, I don't cross. I watch.

9:05 AM - A woman in a red coat buys coffee from the cart on the corner. She's been there every iteration. Same coat, same coffee order.

9:08 AM - A jogger passes by, earbuds in, hood up. I've seen him before too. Same route, same time.

9:12 AM - A black sedan pulls up to the curb. Tinted windows. Engine running. It sits there, waiting.

That's new.

I pull out my phone and take a photo. The license plate is obscured by dirt. Convenient.

The sedan's driver-side window rolls down an inch. I can't see inside, but I feel eyes watching me.

Then my phone rings.

Unknown number.

I answer. "Hello?"

"Thomas Hart." A woman's voice, distorted by a filter. "You're persistent. I'll give you that."

My blood goes cold. "Who is this?"

"Someone who's been trying to kill you for forty-eight days. You keep noticing things you shouldn't. Keep going places you shouldn't be. It's becoming inconvenient."

"Forty-eight days?" I look around, trying to spot where she's watching from. "I've only been looping for one day. Forty-eight iterations of the same day."

"Your perspective. Not mine." A pause. "From where I'm standing, I've been trying to eliminate you for forty-eight consecutive days. You die, the day resets for you, but time moves forward for me. I wake up on October 18th. Then October 19th. Living with the knowledge that you're going to loop back and interfere again."

My mind reels. "That's impossible."

"Says the man who's died forty-seven times and keeps waking up."

Fair point.

"Why?" I ask. "Why are you trying to kill me?"

"Because forty-nine days from now, you're going to destroy everything I've worked for. You're going to expose secrets that powerful people want buried. You're going to be a hero." Her voice drips with venom. "And I can't let that happen."

"I'm a data analyst for an insurance company. What secrets could I possibly—"

"October 31st. The Metropolitan Bank hack. $847 million stolen from secured accounts. The theft that gets traced back to Senator Morrison's campaign fund. The scandal that brings down an entire corruption network." She pauses. "You're the one who finds the evidence. You're the whistleblower who breaks the story."

I have no idea what she's talking about. "I don't know anything about a bank hack."

"Not yet. But you will. In the normal timeline—the one where you survive today—you stumble across the evidence while doing routine audit work. You take it to the FBI. You become the key witness."

"So you're killing me to prevent me from exposing corruption?"

"I'm killing you to preserve the current power structure. Morrison and his friends are useful to certain... interests. Your heroic revelation would destabilize carefully maintained systems." She sounds almost bored. "Nothing personal. You're just a problem that needs solving."

The black sedan's engine revs. I take a step back.

"Forty-eight iterations," the woman continues. "Forty-eight different methods. You've been surprisingly difficult to kill cleanly. But I'm done being subtle. This iteration, I'm going to shoot you. Right now. In front of witnesses. I'll disappear in the chaos. And when you loop back, I'll try again. And again. Until eventually, you give up. Until you decide that living the same day forever is better than constantly dying."

"People will see. They'll identify you."

"Will they? Masks are common. Cameras malfunction. Witnesses misremember. And I have resources that make problems disappear." The window rolls down further. I see the barrel of a gun. "Goodbye, Thomas. See you tomorrow. From my perspective, anyway."

She fires.

---

## 7:42 AM - Iteration 49

I wake up gasping, my chest aching with phantom pain where the bullet hit.

She's right. I'm starting to wear down. The deaths are getting more brutal. More violent. And knowing that she has days to plan while I'm stuck in a loop... I don't know how to win this.

But I know I can't give up.

If what she said is true—if I'm supposed to expose a major corruption scandal—then giving up isn't just surrendering my life. It's surrendering justice for everyone hurt by that corruption.

I have to find another way.

I open my laptop and start researching. Senator Morrison. Metropolitan Bank. October 31st.

If I'm going to expose a bank hack, I need to find the evidence before that date. Which means I need to survive long enough to do my job. And if this assassin is going to kill me every October 17th...

Then I need to make October 17th last long enough to find the proof and get it to people who can act on it.

I need to break the loop. But not by escaping the day.

By using it.

---

## 8:30 AM - A New Strategy

I call in sick to work. Then I call the FBI.

"Federal Bureau of Investigation, how may I direct your call?"

"I need to report a murder. Mine. Also massive financial fraud. And a woman who's been trying to kill me across multiple timelines."

Silence. Then: "Sir, have you been drinking?"

"I'm completely sober. Look, I know how this sounds. But I need to speak to someone in Financial Crimes. It's about the Metropolitan Bank hack that's going to happen on October 31st."

"Sir, if you have information about a crime that hasn't occurred yet—"

"I'll explain everything. Please. Just connect me to someone who handles major financial investigations."

They put me on hold. I wait, knowing that I have maybe an hour before the assassin finds me. She knows I went to the FBI in iteration 32. I died in a car crash on the way to the field office. "Brake failure."

This time, I'm not going to the field office. I'm going to bring the FBI to me.

A new voice comes on the line. "This is Special Agent Rebecca Cole. I understand you have information about a potential bank hack?"

"Yes. And I know you're not going to believe me, but I need you to listen carefully and write this down."

I tell her everything. The loop. The deaths. The assassin. The corruption network. The evidence I'm supposedly going to find.

To her credit, Agent Cole doesn't hang up immediately.

"Mr. Hart, these are serious allegations. But you're asking me to investigate a crime that hasn't happened based on information you received from... a time loop."

"I know. But here's the thing—if I'm wrong, you've wasted an hour of your time. If I'm right, you're about to uncover one of the biggest financial scandals of the decade." I take a breath. "And if nothing else, there's definitely someone trying to kill me. I can prove that part."

"How?"

"Send an agent to the corner of Main and 5th at 9:00 AM. Watch what happens when I stand there. Watch for the black sedan, license obscured, that will try to kill me. If I'm crazy, nothing happens and you can arrest me for wasting federal resources. If I'm right..."

"If you're right, you'll be dead."

"Not for long. That's the benefit of a time loop. I'll wake up tomorrow—well, today again—and we can try a different approach."

Agent Cole is quiet for a long moment. "Stay where you are. I'm sending agents to your location. Do not go to that intersection. Do not engage with anyone suspicious. Just wait."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. If this is a hoax, you're going to jail."

"Deal."

I hang up and wait. The FBI agents arrive at 8:47 AM. They sweep my apartment, take my statement, examine my notes about the forty-nine iterations.

At 9:00 AM, Agent Cole herself arrives.

"We've got surveillance on Main and 5th," she says. "The black sedan is there. Tinted windows, obscured plates, exactly where you said it would be."

"She's waiting for me."

"She won't get to you. We have agents in position." Cole looks at my computer screen, at the timeline of deaths I've documented. "Mr. Hart, I've seen a lot of strange things in this job. But this..."

"I know."

"Walk me through the Metropolitan Bank hack. Everything you said on the phone."

I tell her what the assassin told me. The $847 million theft. Senator Morrison. The corruption network. My role as the whistleblower who finds the evidence.

"Do you have the evidence now?" Cole asks.

"No. I'm not supposed to find it until my normal audit work later this month. But if I'm stuck in this loop, I can't get to it. Unless..."

We look at each other.

"Unless we get it now," Cole finishes. "Break into the bank's systems. Force the timeline."

"Is that legal?"

"With probable cause and a warrant? Yes." She pulls out her phone. "And what you've told me—combined with a credible assassination attempt—gives me probable cause. Let me make some calls."

While Cole works on the warrant, I watch the clock. 9:15 AM. I died the first time at this moment.

My phone buzzes. Unknown number.

I answer. "Still alive."

The assassin sounds furious. "You called the FBI."

"Seemed like the smart move."

"They can't protect you forever. The loop will reset. You'll wake up tomorrow, and I'll try again. Eventually you'll make a mistake. Eventually I'll win."

"Maybe. But now the FBI knows about you. Knows about Morrison. Knows about the hack." I glance at Agent Cole. "Every iteration I survive, I tell them more. Eventually, they'll have enough to investigate even without my evidence. You've made me too visible to kill quietly."

Silence on the other end.

Then: "You think you're clever. But you're trapped, Thomas. In this loop, in this day. You can't move forward. Can't build a case. Can't testify. You're frozen in time while the world moves on."

"So are you," I point out. "As long as I keep looping, you keep reliving today. You can't get to October 31st. Can't warn Morrison. Can't do anything except try to kill me."

"I can wait. Can you?"

She hangs up.

Agent Cole looks up from her phone. "Warrant approved. We're accessing Metropolitan Bank's systems now. If there's evidence of fraud, we'll find it."

"How long?"

"Hours. Maybe less." She pauses. "Thomas, about the loop. Do you know what causes it? How to break it?"

"No idea. I just keep waking up at 7:42 AM."

"What happens if you survive the full day? Past midnight?"

"I don't know. I've never made it that far."

Cole nods slowly. "Then that's our goal. Keep you alive for sixteen and a half more hours. Get the evidence we need. Build a case. And see if midnight breaks the loop."

"And if it doesn't?"

"Then we try again tomorrow. With more resources. More protection. Until we find a way to stop her permanently."

It's not a perfect plan. But it's the first plan that feels like it might actually work.

---

## 4:37 PM - Evidence

The FBI finds it.

Agent Cole shows me the files on her encrypted laptop. Transaction records. Shell companies. Money flowing from the bank to Senator Morrison's campaign through a dozen laundered steps. And scheduled for October 31st—a massive transfer that would drain secured accounts and disappear into offshore havens.

"This is it," Cole says. "This is what you were supposed to find. What you were going to die to prevent from exposing."

"Can you stop it? The hack?"

"We can shut it down. Freeze the accounts. But we need more than this to build a RICO case. We need testimony from inside the network. We need someone to flip."

"Do you have suspects?"

"Several. But approaching them tips our hand. If Morrison knows we're investigating, he'll bury the evidence. We need to wait until—"

Her phone rings. She answers, listens, goes pale.

"Understood. Lockdown protocol." She hangs up. "We have a problem."

"What?"

"The black sedan. It's gone. And security footage from Main and 5th shows the driver getting out approximately thirty minutes ago." She pulls up a grainy image. A woman in dark clothing, face obscured by a mask. "We think she's coming for you."

"How? Your agents are watching the building."

"Are they?" Cole looks worried. "Thomas, if this woman has the resources you say she does—if she's working for Morrison's corruption network—she might have access to law enforcement resources. Might even have agents inside the Bureau."

The lights flicker.

Cole draws her weapon. "Backup power should've kicked in immediately. That didn't happen."

"She cut the power."

"More likely she has someone on the inside who cut it." Cole moves to the door, radio crackling. "All agents, status report."

Static.

"Radios are jammed," I say. "She's isolating us."

Cole looks at me. "There's an emergency exit. Back stairs. Can you make it to the street?"

"What about you?"

"I'm armed and trained. You're the target. Go. Get somewhere public. Witnesses. She won't risk exposure if there are too many people watching."

I don't want to leave her. But she's right—I'm the target. Drawing the assassin away from the FBI agents protects them.

I run.

---

## 5:43 PM - The Chase

I make it four blocks before I see her.

The woman from the car. The assassin who's killed me forty-nine times. She's following me, not even trying to hide. We're in a crowded shopping district—exactly where Agent Cole told me to go—but the assassin doesn't seem concerned.

She's wearing the mask still, but I can see her eyes. Cold. Professional. Patient.

I duck into a department store. Weave through racks of clothing, past confused shoppers, toward the emergency exit. Behind me, the assassin follows at a steady pace. Not rushing. Just inevitable.

I burst out into an alley. Bad move—no witnesses here. But the street is just ahead. I run.

She shoots.

The bullet hits the wall beside my head. Concrete chips spray. I stumble, keep running. The street is right there—

Another shot. This one hits my leg.

I go down hard, pain exploding through my thigh. The assassin walks up calmly, gun pointed at my head.

"You've been clever," she says. Her voice isn't filtered now. It's familiar somehow. "But this is iteration forty-nine. I've learned all your tricks. Called the FBI? They can't save you. Every agent assigned to protect you is either compromised or delayed. You're alone, Thomas. Just like you were always going to be."

"The evidence is already with the FBI," I gasp out. "Killing me doesn't stop the investigation."

"No. But it stops you from testifying. And without your testimony connecting the dots, the case falls apart. Morrison's lawyers will bury it in procedure." She aims. "You were supposed to be a hero. Instead, you're just a footnote."

I close my eyes.

The gun doesn't fire.

I open my eyes. Agent Cole is behind the assassin, weapon drawn.

"Federal agent! Drop the weapon!"

The assassin doesn't drop it. Instead, she turns slowly, and I see her face as the mask comes off.

I know her.

Agent Rebecca Cole.

Both of them.

"What the hell?" I breathe.

The assassin—the other Cole—smiles. "Time loop isn't just yours, Thomas. It's mine too. Every iteration, I wake up one day ahead of you. October 18th, while you're stuck in the 17th. I've been living forty-nine days while you lived one. Forty-nine chances to stop you. Forty-nine versions of today, learning, adapting."

The real Cole—the one who helped me—keeps her gun steady. "I'm calling this in—"

"No you're not," the other Cole says. "Because I'm you. I'm what you become after forty-nine days of trying to stop him and failing. After Morrison's people get to you. After they offer you a choice: help us, or die with Hart."

"That's not going to happen."

"It already did. Forty-nine times." The other Cole shoots.

---

## 7:42 AM - Iteration 50

I wake up screaming.

Both Coles died. The real one shot by her future self. The assassin shot by someone else—I didn't see who. And me, bleeding out in the alley, watching them both die.

Fifty iterations. Fifty deaths. And now I know the terrible truth.

Agent Rebecca Cole helps me. Gets corrupted. Becomes the assassin who kills me. The loop affects both of us, but differently. I reset to the same day. She moves forward one day at a time, until she becomes the monster trying to kill me.

How do I stop someone who's learning from a future that hasn't happened yet?

How do I save someone from becoming their worst self?

I grab my phone and call the FBI. Ask for Agent Rebecca Cole.

"This is Cole."

"Rebecca. It's Thomas Hart. Don't hang up. I need to tell you something, and you're not going to believe me. But I need you to listen."

"Mr. Hart? How did you get this number?"

"We've met. Or we will meet. In about forty-five minutes, you're going to get a call about a man reporting a time loop and assassination attempts. You're going to think I'm crazy. You're going to help me anyway. And by the end of today, you're going to die. Unless we change something right now."

Silence.

"I'm listening," she says carefully.

I tell her everything. The loop. The deaths. The evidence about Morrison. And crucially, I tell her what she becomes. The assassin. The corrupted agent who kills me to protect a senator's corruption.

"You're saying I'm going to try to kill you?"

"Not you. A version of you that's lived through forty-nine days while I've lived one. A version that got compromised by Morrison's network. I need to break that pattern. And I think the only way to do that is to work with you before you get corrupted."

"This is insane."

"I know. But in thirty minutes, you can verify every fact I'm telling you. The black sedan. The location. The assassination attempts. Everything." I take a breath. "And if I'm wrong, you can arrest me. But if I'm right, we need to move fast. Because somewhere out there, a version of you from forty-nine days in the future is already planning how to kill me today."

"If this time loop is real, how do we break it?"

"I think we expose the scandal. Get the evidence public. Remove Morrison's motivation to kill me. If he's already arrested, there's no point in stopping me from becoming a whistleblower."

"That's a big if."

"It's the only option I can see. Will you help me?"

A long pause. I can hear her breathing, thinking, weighing whether I'm a lunatic or telling the impossible truth.

Finally: "Where are you right now?"

"My apartment. 2247 Riverside, Unit 4B."

"Stay there. I'm coming to you. And Hart? If this is a hoax, you're going to regret wasting my time."

"If it's a hoax, I'll go to jail grateful that I only have one life to worry about."

She hangs up.

I wait. Watch the clock. Think about all the ways this could go wrong.

But for the first time in fifty iterations, I feel something like hope.

---

## 11:23 PM - Breaking Point

It took all day, but we did it.

Agent Cole—the real one, the uncorrupted one—used my information to fast-track the investigation. By noon, the FBI had warrants. By 3 PM, they had evidence. By 6 PM, they had Senator Morrison in custody.

By 8 PM, the story broke nationwide. The Metropolitan Bank hack exposed. The corruption network unraveled. My role as the source kept carefully anonymous—I didn't need to be a hero. I just needed to survive.

And the assassin never showed.

"She might not exist anymore," Cole said as we watched the clock tick toward midnight. "If her timeline was dependent on Morrison needing to stop you, and Morrison's already arrested, she might have never become... that."

"Or she might show up at 11:59 and kill us both," I said.

"Always the optimist."

We waited in FBI protective custody. Armed agents. Secure location. Every precaution.

11:45 PM. Nothing.

11:55 PM. Still nothing.

11:59 PM.

The clock ticked over to midnight.

October 18th.

I didn't reset.

"It worked," I breathed. "It actually worked."

Cole smiled. "Congratulations, Mr. Hart. You survived October 17th."

"Only took fifty-one tries."

"Fifty-one that you remember. Who knows how many loops there were before you started counting." She stood. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow we'll need your full statement about Morrison's operation."

"Tomorrow. Right. That's a day that exists now." I felt dizzy with the concept. "Thank you, Agent Cole. For believing me. For not becoming... the other you."

"Thank you for warning me." She paused at the door. "Though I have to admit, part of me wonders what it would have been like. Living forty-nine days of the same investigation. Whether I really would have been corrupted, or if there was some other explanation."

"Let's not find out."

"Agreed." She left.

I lay down on the cot in the safe house and closed my eyes. For the first time in what felt like forever, I fell asleep not knowing exactly what tomorrow would bring.

It was terrifying.

It was wonderful.

---

## October 19th - 7:42 AM

I woke up to my alarm.

Different room. Different bed. But same time: 7:42 AM.

I grabbed my phone. October 19th. The date had changed.

I'd escaped the loop.

I spent the next few days giving statements to the FBI. Watching the Morrison case develop. Seeing the corruption network fall apart as more evidence came to light.

My role was kept quiet. Anonymous source. Whistleblower protection. I went back to my normal life with the surreal knowledge that I'd saved the world by dying fifty-one times.

Three weeks later, I got a package. No return address.

Inside was a note written in familiar handwriting:

*Thomas,*

*I don't know if you'll remember me. In your timeline, we may have never met. But in mine, we worked together for forty-nine days. I became someone I didn't recognize. Did things I can't take back.*

*But that timeline doesn't exist anymore. You broke it. Saved me from becoming that person.*

*Thank you.*

*- R.C.*

I stared at the note. The assassin version of Agent Cole shouldn't exist. That timeline had been overwritten. But somehow, she remembered.

Somehow, in breaking my loop, I'd broken hers too.

I never heard from her again.

But sometimes, late at night, I wonder: how many loops are there? How many versions of ourselves are living different choices, different outcomes, different lives?

And how many times have we died without knowing it, only to wake up and try again?

I lived fifty-one versions of October 17th.

How many versions of every other day have I lived without noticing?

It's a disturbing thought.

But also, in a strange way, comforting.

Because it means that somewhere, in some timeline, we all get another chance.

We all get to try again.

And maybe, if we're lucky—if we're persistent—we eventually get it right.

---

**THE END**

*"Time is a flat circle. Unless you know how to break the loop. Then it's just a really, really long Monday."*
